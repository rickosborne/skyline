# data

This directory contains programmatic data and templates used as inputs to generate text, instead of writing it by hand.
The hope here is this will lead to fewer errors and less work.

Areas of interest:

* [machine](machine) — data for the various machine enemies
* [schema](schema) — schemas for the various types of data
