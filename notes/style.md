# Style

This really needs to be converted into a Style Guide.

* [Meta descriptions of AIs use "it" / "they" pronouns.](../guide/setting/203-ai-gender.md)
  * Exception for GAIA, given her presentation?
  * Need to get some sensitivity direction here

* Signal canon vs non-canon to the reader
  * Probably want an explicit section on this
  * Do we want a scale of some kind?  To differentiate "likely, but not official" from "wild-assed guess"?

* Signal "story mode" vs "hard mode" options to the reader
  * Probably want an explicit section on this
  * Ex: health potion vs botanical efficacy
