# To-Do Code

This isn't supposed to be a coding project, dammit!

* Book converters
  * Maybe [Electric Book](https://github.com/electricbookworks/electric-book)?
  * Maybe [Gitbook](https://www.gitbook.com/)?

* Stats data schema and tooling
  * Because I really don't want to maintain all those adapters by hand
  * CI tests to ensure correct materialization
  * Entities
    * Character stats
    * Character maneuvers
    * Equipment stats

* My intuition is that I'm going to want _some_ amount of a Markdown-based #include preprocessing functionality
  * Front matter & back matter
  * DRY & consistency
  * But how do I want this to work with GitHub and Pages?
    * Materialized include blocks, like the old $Version$ processing?

* More advanced linting than just IJ code scanning

* CI job to build and release PDFs

* Custom Pages/Jekyll theme

* If I ever get art assets, how do I want to manage that?
  * Large asset files
  * SVG preferred, obv
  * External artifact repo permission management (ugh)
