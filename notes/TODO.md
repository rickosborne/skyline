# To-Do Items

This list is just an unsorted jumble of reminders.

* Need to come up with a name and terminology for the anti-grav tech
  * https://github.com/rickosborne/skyline/issues/9
  * "EMAG" â€” Electromagnetic Anti-Gravity?
  * "EMAG discs"?

* Section on force fields
  * https://github.com/rickosborne/skyline/issues/10
  * High power consumption
  * Disruptable

* Section on holography versus AR versus nanotech
  * https://github.com/rickosborne/skyline/issues/11
  * Old One computers use holographic displays.
    Generally can't be removed from the facilities.
    It's non-obvious which physical parts create the projections.
  * Focus overlays use AR
    * Neural interface is heavily implied
      * No one else can hear or see what Aloy sees
      * Shutting down HADES introduces full-sensory override and feedback
  * _Some_ amount of nanotech is implied
    * Biomass conversion (black particle swarm)
    * HADES red swirls?

* Power and Battery tech
  * https://github.com/rickosborne/skyline/issues/12
  * I believe in the end scene, when Sobeck is telling the story about her mother, she uses the term "autobattery".
    Maybe she's just saying "auto battery", as in "battery from a vehicle"?
  * Either way, we need some consistent way of explaining how devices retain charge.
  * We can assume battery tech is amazing, but still has to obey physics.
  * Assume batteries and power cores can be harvested from machines?
  * Maybe the MINERVA towers also act as Tesla-style wireless energy sources?
    * Which could have interesting "you must construct additional pylons" implications.

* Focus network
  * https://github.com/rickosborne/skyline/issues/13
  * Sylens had to help rebuild the Focus network, on behalf of HADES
  * But MINERVA towers seem to be distinct from that
  * Maybe Focus tech post-dates the comms built into the FARO robots, which needed to have global reach?
  * Akin to 5G versus Bluetooth and NFC

* Prejudice
  * https://github.com/rickosborne/skyline/issues/14
  * Will need a section on this in the [Setting Guide](../guide/setting).
  * No canon mentions of New World racism (yay!)
  * Some canon mentions of New World sexism (boo!)
    * Should make it clear this should be a choice for players, not an assumption
  * Plenty of canon mentions of tribalism (obv)

* Religion & Spiritualism
  * https://github.com/rickosborne/skyline/issues/15
  * /sigh
  * Carja Sundom
  * Eclipse Buried Shadow
  * Banuk "mysticism" (per Sylens)

* Region names
  * Forbidden West
  * Sylens makes some reference to Nora lands as "Savage East" or something like that?  Maybe 2/3 through?
  * Sylens mentions another, unseen group of people.  Maybe started with an "O"?

* Healing
  * https://github.com/rickosborne/skyline/issues/16
  * Healers
  * Efficacy
    * HoTs vs stims
  * Botanical pharmacology
    * DEMETER
    * Targeted bioengineering
  * Health potions
  * Introduce toxicity as an optional effect?  (ugh)

* Magic & Fantasy
  * https://github.com/rickosborne/skyline/issues/17
  * Do we want a section on this?
  * Like "hey, if you want to presume that the Old Ones were in the Shadowrun setting, that would imply Orcs etc in the New World"
