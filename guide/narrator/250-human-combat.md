## Human-vs-Human Combat in Skyline

A note from Rick Osborne, the author:

> I have chosen to omit human NPCs as combat enemies in the world of _Skyline_.
> This is my way of encouraging players to find ways to resolve conflicts with other thinking, feeling people through means other than murder.
> Even if those people are fiction, I dislike such othering and vilification, and this is my small effort to improve how we think about each other.
>
> I love combat in tabletop gaming â€” it's been a part of the history of the genre, and is not going anywhere, nor would I want it to.
> My hope is that I can give you enough other fun, non-human things to fight, to scratch that itch.
> And if I do my job right, when you need to resolve conflicts between people you'll have plenty of non-combat options. 
>
> I'm not saying you can't have humans fight each other in _Skyline_.
> Human combat is canon in the world of _Horizon_.
> But within these modules you won't find any stat blocks for "bandits", Shadow Carja, or any other humans.
> If you choose to bring human combat into your game in _Skyline_, that's your right because it's your game, but you'll have to do the work.
