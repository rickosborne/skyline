## Travel Speed

Many game systems will have their own rules for overland travel speeds, durations, etc.
Refer to your system, or your system adapter, for the appropriate values for your system.
The values presented here are broad strokes, and should not be considered hard limits.

### Foot Speed

These values presume normal humans with up to light encumbrance.

| Travel Method | mi/h | km/h | mi/day | km/day | Limit | Assumptions |
| :--- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | :---: | :--- |
| Walking, on road | 3 mi/h | 5 km/h | 24-30 mi | 40-50 km | 8-10 hr | Clear weather, daytime |
| Walking, off-road | 1.5 mi/h | 2.5 km/h | 12-15 mi | 20-25 km | 8-10 hr | Clear weather, daytime, uneven terrain |
| Running, on road | 6 mi/h | 10 km/h | - | - | 1-3 hr | Clear weather, daytime |
| Sprinting, on road | 12 mi/h | 20 km/h | - | - | 1-5 min | Clear weather, daytime, sure footing |

**Walking:**
Most travel times in _Skyline_ are listed as walking times.
Unless specified otherwise, these assume 8 to 10 hours of walking along roads in clear weather for the 8-10 hrs of daylight, stopping for an hour for lunch and other breaks.
This gives an effective daily travel distance of 24-30 mi (40-50 km).

**Running:**
Athletic humans can maintain a running pace longer than the 3hr listed above, but it requires training.
Maintaining that pace while encumbered requires even more training.

**Sprinting:**
Average humans can maintain a sprint for about 1 minute, or a little shy of a quarter mile.
Moderate training in athletic humans can get this to 5 minutes, or about 1 mi (1.6 km).
It takes daily, Olympic-level training to get this to an hour.

**World Records:**
The world record for the marathon (26mi/42km) is almost exactly 2 hours, or 13 mi/h (21 km/h).
Usain Bolt's 200m world record almost doubles the pace above, for 20 mi/h (37 km/h), but only for 20 seconds.
By the time you get up to the mi/km distance, world record speeds are closer to 16 mi/h (26 km/h).
For ultra distance, the 100km record is just over 6 hr, for an average 10 mi/h (16 km/h).

### Mounted Speed

For simplicity, all basic machine mounts in _Skyline_ use the same speed and range.
This includes Striders, Broadheads, and Chargers.
Like horses and humans, _Skyline_ mounts have a range which diminishes with speed — the faster you go, the quicker you wear out.
While machine mounts do not tire as horses would, their riders do — humans become just as exhausted after a day of riding as they do with a day of walking.

| Mount Speed | mi/h | km/h | mi/day | km/day | Limits | Assumptions |
| :--- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | :---: | :--- |
| Walking, human speed | 3 mi/h | 5 km/h | 24-30 mi | 40-50 km | 8-10 hr | Clear weather, daytime |
| Walking, machine speed | 4.3 mi/h | 7 km/h | 34-43 mi | 56-70 km | 8-10 hr | Clear weather, daytime |
| Walking, off-road | 2 mi/h | 3.2 km/h | 16-20 mi | 26-32 km | 8-10 hr | Clear weather, daytime, uneven terrain |
| Trot, on road | 8 mi/h | 13 km/h | 64-80 mi | 104-130 km | 8-10 hr | Clear weather, daytime, consumes Blaze |
| Trot, off road | 4 mi/h | 6.4 km/h | 32-40 mi | 51-64 km | 8-10 hr | Clear weather, daytime, consumes 3&times; Blaze |
| Gallop, on road | 24 mi/h | 39 km/h | 192-240 mi | 310-390 km | 8-10 hr | Clear weather, daytime, consumes 3&times; Blaze |

**Walking:**
While machine mounts can comfortably walk at the 3 mi/h (5 km/h) human pace, they can also walk a little faster, 4.3 mi/h (7 km/h), before they break into a trot.
They can sustain this for an entire day without significant effort.

**Off-road:**
Terrain sensors allow machine mounts to make better time off-road than humans: 2 mi/h (3.7 km/h) for machine mounts versus 1.5 mi/h (2 km/h) for humans.
Riders should keep an eye on the mount's Blaze levels — maintaining this speed over rough terrain will start to consume Blaze.
Similarly, uphill climbs which would cause a human to get winded will also cause the mount to consume Blaze.

**Range:**
Exhausting mounts occurs in two ways: fuel and wear.
For any effort beyond a walk, mounts use Blaze canisters as their fuel source, which will get consumed over time and need to be replaced every 100mi (160km).
Faster speeds and rough terrain increase Blaze consumption, reducing this range.

Sustained journeys of several hundred miles, even at a walking pace, break down the body components of mounts, eventually riding the mount into the ground.
Unless the mount is repaired for 1 hr for every 100mi (160km) of travel, the mount will degrade to the point of becoming nonfunctional within 500mi (800km).
This kind of repair work takes time and focus, so characters can't do much more than eat a meal at the same time.

In practical terms, this means that without repairs a fresh mount will last ~21hr at a gallop, consuming 15 Blaze canisters in the time it takes to cover that 500mi range.

## Reference Distances

Here are some distances between major cities and gates (see [Places](../setting/500-places.md) in the Narrator Guide), and the time in days it takes to make the journey.
These distances are via roads and other human-traversable routes, and do not represent straight-line distances.
