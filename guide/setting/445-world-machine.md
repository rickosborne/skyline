## World Machine

Unlike the spiritual and religious beliefs of the other tribes, [Oseram](325-oseram.md) believe the world is an intricate machine.
While no one person can understand the entire machine at once, continued research and innovation can broaden one's ability to perceive its mechanism.
It was the failure of the Old Ones to maintain the machine of the world which led to their downfall.

In practical terms, belief in the world machine is not that some divine being created it, but that every part of the surrounding world is inextricably linked with every other part.
Changes to one part, whether for the better or the worse, ripple through all connected parts.
If you're smart and industrious enough to see the connections, you have the power to effect great change, or to take advantage of those who do not.

It is not canon to _Horizon_ lore, but in _Skyline_ the Oseram belief in the world machine gives them an interesting view of the Utaru.
Utaru beliefs of the cycles of birth, life, decay, and rebirth, are viewed by the Oseram as a primitive version of their own, more logical views.
Some Oseram view this negatively, as if Utaru choose to live in ignorance even though they are so close to understanding.
Others see Utaru intuitions about reality as far closer than other tribes, and are impressed that a people without mechanical curiosity could develop that intuition to the point they have.
This has led a number of Oseram, especially women fleeing the Oseram patriarchy, to make the journey to resettle in Utaru lands.
