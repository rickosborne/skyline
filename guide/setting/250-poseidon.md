## POSEIDON

One of GAIA's subordinate functions released to become an independent AI, POSEIDON was charged with cleaning up the water of Earth's biosphere.
Canonically, not much is known of POSEIDON.

In Elisabet Sobeck's hologram overview of the GAIA's subordinate functions, mention of POSEIDON is juxtaposed with the visual of a machine which looks like a Snapmaw.
As the Snapmaw is the only marine (or at least amphibious) machine seen in _HZD_, it may be fair to assume it is under the purview of POSEIDON.
The infographics displayed alongside the Snapmaw could be interpreted as a representation of the process of purifying water.
Given the diversity of land machines, it would be safe to presume the Snapmaw was not the only marine or amphibious machine, nor the only machine dedicated to the work of POSEIDON.

The canonical whereabouts or disposition of POSEIDON are not known as of _HZD_.

{:.aside}
The ancient Egyptian deity Sobek was associated with Nile crocodiles, royal power, fertility, and protection from harm.
_Skyline_ assumes the Zero Dawn Alpha in charge of POSEIDON used crocodiles for the Snapmaw model as an homage to Dr. Sobeck, who also worked tirelessly to protect all of humanity.

The POSEIDON AI plays a part in the [_Connection_](../../story/connection) story module.
