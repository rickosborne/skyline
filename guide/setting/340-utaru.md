## Utaru

Canonically, not much is known of the Utaru, beyond their agrarian roots and the name of their homeland: Plainsong.
They are depicted in _HZD_ as wearing clothing reminiscent of woven grasses, with some machine parts as armor and ornamentation, but relatively less machine prevalence than other tribes.
Utaru are also known for their yellow face any body paint, mirroring the golden grains of Plainsong.

### Culture

It is implied that most Utaru are farmers, or at least have some sort of agrarian connection with the land.
They also have a seasonal outlook, accepting the inevitability of death and the regrowth that comes from a return to the soil.

In _HZD_, the map showing the locations of the Metal Flowers is said to have been made by an Utaru botanist.
This aligns with the Utaru connection with nature and agriculture, and may imply something of a link with [DEMETER](220-demeter.md).

### Utaru in _Skyline_

As the lore and presentation of the Utaru lean heavily on Native American and African tribal themes, players creating Utaru characters should be thoughtful in their portrayal.
While obviously the Utaru, descending from those released from [ELEUTHIA-9](240-eleuthia.md), cannot actually _be_ Native American or African, players should try to avoid reducing their characterization to stereotypes and tropes.
Should you choose to tell tribal stories through Utaru characters, ensure you have put in the work to build a respectful, complete picture.

Also, while _Horizon_ lore canonizes that Utaru were slaughtered _en masse_ and taken by Carja as slaves during the Red Raids, players should talk with each other about how much of that lore is comfortable territory for all at the table.
It's also perfectly acceptable to play an Utaru without that particular backstory, and instead just with an adventurous wanderlust.
Or, perhaps, maybe your Utaru is on a mission from the DEMETER AI.
