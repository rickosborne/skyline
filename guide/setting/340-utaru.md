## Utaru

Canonically, not much is known of the Utaru, beyond their agrarian roots and the name of their homeland: Plainsong.
They are depicted in _HZD_ as wearing clothing reminiscent of woven grasses, with some machine parts as armor and ornamentation, but relatively less machine prevalence than other tribes.
Utaru are also known for their yellow face any body paint, mirroring the golden grains of Plainsong.

### Culture

It is implied that most Utaru are farmers, or at least have some sort of agrarian connection with the land.
They also have a seasonal outlook, accepting the inevitability of death and the regrowth that comes from a return to the soil.

In _HZD_, the map showing the locations of the Metal Flowers is said to have been made by an Utaru botanist.
This aligns with the Utaru connection with nature and agriculture, and may imply something of a link with [DEMETER](220-demeter.md).

### Scythes

_Scythes are not canon in Horizon â€” they have been created for Skyline._

An Utaru who has been tasked with investigating and resolving an issue, or with a task which may necessitate authority or a show of force, is referred to as a Scythe.
The etymology is as you might expect: they are the embodiment of long, functional, and potentially deadly tools serving some productive purpose.
Utaru Scythes are roughly equivalent to Nora Braves, but are generally more task-oriented.
One can take on the role of Scythe for a particular task, and then leave that role behind once the task is complete.

The Utaru still have a fully-functional justice system of judges, advocates, law enforcement, etc., distinct from Scythes.
The role of investigation has been divided from judgment, legislation, and execution, with the idea that facts and truth should exist outside of those concerns.

Scythes are often commissioned in Deeproot, dispatched to the corners of Plainsong for various reasons.
It is not uncommon to work in the other direction: a villager will "take up the snaith" to perform a local investigation, or to deliver a message to Deeproot or another village.
When commissioned for long-term efforts, it is common to pair up Scythes.

{:.aside}
The "snaith" is the name of the long wooden shaft of a scythe.

Acting in the role of Scythe is almost always signaled by carrying an actual, working scythe.
Like any badge of authority, Scythes may have to make it clear when they have "put down their blade" and are acting outside of their role.
In confrontational circumstances, one might see the Scythe drive the shaft of their weapon into the ground, flying the blade like a flag, and stepping away to handle the situation "fairly".

Most Utaru would have training in scythe use since early teenage years, and would be comfortable using one in an agricultural context.
Utaru scythes are made with configurable blades: the heel (the joint between the blade and snaith) has thick pins which can be removed to reseat the blade at multiple angles.
Common configurations include collapsed (with the blade against the shaft), "right" for agricultural use, and extended (like a polearm).
The latter is generally only an option for scythes with modified blades, for those who have trained on how to use it this way.
Collapsing and wrapping the blade makes the scythe safer for travel, and less threatening when combined with decorations, crucial when outside of Plainsong.
The blades then take time to unwrap and reconfigure, but unlike Nora Braves, Utaru Scythes do not usually expect danger around every corner.

While not common, some people choose to try to make a living out of taking on one Scythe task after another.
Such people are referred to as "Pinned" Scythes, referring to how often they must adjust the pins on the heel of their scythe to repeatedly switch between tasks.

The role of Scythe is considered a serious, almost sacred duty, as they are expected to be thorough, impartial, and forthcoming.
Scythes are given deference and leeway by all Utaru, regardless of background or status.
Attempting to deceive a Scythe would be considered a serious crime to most Utaru, almost on the level of murder.
It is exceedingly rare for Scythes to lose the faith of those they represent, such that the few occasions it has happened are almost myths or folklore, and are told to scare children.

### Utaru in _Skyline_

As the canonical _Horizon_ lore and presentation of the Utaru lean heavily on Native American and African tribal themes, players creating Utaru characters should be thoughtful in their portrayal.
While obviously the Utaru, descending from those released from [ELEUTHIA-9](240-eleuthia.md), cannot actually _be_ Native American or African, players should try to avoid reducing their characterization to stereotypes and tropes.
Should you choose to tell tribal stories through Utaru characters, ensure you have put in the work to build a respectful, complete picture.

Also, while _Horizon_ lore canonizes that Utaru were slaughtered _en masse_ and taken by Carja as slaves during the Red Raids, players should talk with each other about how much of that lore is comfortable territory for all at the table.
It's also perfectly acceptable to play an Utaru without that particular backstory, and instead just with an adventurous wanderlust.
Or, perhaps, maybe your Utaru is on a mission from the DEMETER AI.
