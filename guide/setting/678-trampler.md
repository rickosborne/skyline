### History

While the first recorded Hunter's Lodge hunt of a Trampler was in the time of Hivas (the 12th Sun-King), the history of the Sun-Kings points to an earlier reference of the machine: Juawadan (the 4th Sun-King) is said to have "stocked the metal markets with the spoils of his own Trampler hunts".
This would imply Tramplers, in some form, have been around for at least 200 years.
