## Stormbird

TODO

### Flying Speed

Stormbird cruising speed is just over 80 mi/h (ca. 130 km/h).
It loses 5 mi/h (8 km/h) for every 400 lb (180kg) it has to carry, to a maximum carrying capacity of 1600lb (ca. 720kg).

Like other machines, it has "run" and "sprint" variants on this speed, which are double (160 mi/h, 260 km/h) and quadruple (320 mi/h, 520 km/h) that value.
These faster speed also consume Blaze, at a rate of 4 and 10 canisters per hour, respectively.
Speed losses due to weight are also doubled and quadrupled for those speeds, respectively.
If forced to sustain its "sprint" speed, stresses on the engines and airframe will tear the Stormbird apart in under 4 hours (ca. 1200mi / 1900km).
Its "run" speed can be sustained for up to 10 hours, at which time it will need 1 hour of repairs to continue.

### Stormbirds as Mounts

As with [Glinthawks](630-glinthawk.md), _Skyline_ leaves it up to the Narrator to decide whether Stormbirds can be mounted, or used to carry players.
Stormbirds are even faster than Glinthawks, adding in engine exhaust to worry about.

It's your game: if you want to travel via Stormbird, you go right ahead.
There's nothing in _Skyline_ which says you can't.
