## Oseram

There's no canonical record of the origins of the Oseram, whose home territory is to the north of the Carja Sundom, capitaled by the city of Mainspring.
A single [datapoint of the Old Ones](https://horizon.fandom.com/wiki/The_Old_Ones_(Datapoint)) gives a brief mention of the beliefs of the Oseram: a group which believes in the mechanical interconnectedness of the world, driving the need to understand it so it can be maintained and improved.
The Oseram are the most technologically advanced of the tribes in the area, accomplished in metalworking and engineering.
They also have a proclivity for delving the ruins of the Old Ones, which they do not fear or avoid as the other tribes do.

The Oseram became vital allies to [Avad](315-carja.md) during his brief flight from Jiran's persecution, thanks to Avad's relationship with Ersa and Erend, as well as Avad's desire to end the Red Raids constantly attacking Oseram lands.
Avad convinced some, but not all, of the Oseram warlords to aid him in retaking Meridian, sending their freebooters back with him.
The threat of advanced Oseram weaponry sent the Shadow Carja running, cannons raining fire and explosions from afar.

The Oseram and Carja have strengthened their ties since then, with Oseram even providing escorts for Avad's peace-seeking Sun-Priest envoys as they traveled to the other tribes.

### Culture

Oseram pride themselves on their craft, their loyalty, their scholarship, and their honesty.
Their internal government is much looser than their monarchic Carja neighbors, or their Matriarchal Nora forebears.
Canonically, not much is known, but it is hinted that Oseram organize into work parties for specific tasks, implying something more federated and organization-driven than family- or politics-driven.

### Oseram in _Skyline_

As not much is known of the Oseram beyond their penchant for engineering, _Skyline_ does not make significant alterations to their lore, though it does rely on quite a bit of non-canon conjecture.

While most Oseram characters in _HZD_ were shown with heavy focus on crafting and engineering, players should keep in mind that some were not.
Ersa, for example, was shown to be a strong and capable Oseram warrior, regardless of any crafting skill.
It should be perfectly acceptable to play an Oseram with limited tinkering or engineering ability.
