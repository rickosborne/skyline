### History

The tale of [the founding of Meridian](https://horizon.fandom.com/wiki/Founding_Of_Meridian) includes references to Glinthawks already roosting atop the mesas and guiding the Carja on their journey.
Glinthawks in the story are portrayed as a positive and helpful presence, and not the terrors from the sky they are seen as today.
Estimates put this account as approximately three centuries before the events of _HZD_.
