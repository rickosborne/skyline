### Animals

Most fauna have not yet been reintroduced into the ecosystem.
The largest animals seen in the wild are boar and goats, both roughly thigh-high to a human.

Species in the wild currently include: badger, boar, fox, goat, goose, owl, rabbit, rat, salmon, squirrel, turkey.

For hunting purposes, most wild animals can be taken down with a single successful hit.
Boar and goats might take an additional hit if the narrative requires it.
Some animals, like owls, are nocturnal and only active at night.

In your setting, you are welcome to introduce other animals which make sense in your local.
However, you will likely want to put some thought into how those animals fit in the ecosystem.
Remember that DEMETER is an entire AI dedicated to rebuilding biomes, and would be quite good at building a food chain.
Rats exist in the wild, so it would be reasonable to introduce animals which eat them, including snakes or smaller felines.
Orangutans, on the other hand, wouldn't make much sense until more fruit-bearing trees and vines had been established.

Of course, that might also make for an interesting indicator that something was wrong with DEMETER: new species showing up and struggling to feed themselves.

Some new animal species which we might presume DEMETER could introduce in the near future:

* Raptors including hawks, falcons, eagles
* Freshwater fish including trout, bass, perch
* Pollinators including bats, bees, butterflies, moths
* Predators and scavengers including wolves, mid-sized canines and felines
