## Creating your own group of people

An entire discussion of the sociological factors of why people create social groups is beyond the scope of this document, but at the risk of oversimplifying and being reductive:

* _People make groups to share goals._
  Maybe there's a short-term project (excavate this site) or a long-term one (establish an agricultural collective).
  Goal-oriented groups often share a common location, but don't necessarily share the same beliefs.
  Often, they may not even share a plan for attaining their goal.

* _People make groups to share beliefs._
  Maybe it's a religion, or maybe it's the start of a city-state or other political structure.
  Beliefs don't necessarily follow geography, so a common location is not always shared.
