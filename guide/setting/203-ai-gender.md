## A quick note on AI gender pronouns

A note from Rick Osborne, the author:

> I have chosen in this text to use gender-neutral pronouns for AIs: "it", "they".
> This includes AIs with female presentation (GAIA), arguably male-sounding voices (HADES), or potentially non-binary (CYAN).
> The original game uses a combination of "it" and gendered pronouns in various combinations.
>
> My intent here is not to de-personalize the AIs, nor to in any way cast them as other.
> Similarly, my use of "they" is in no way an attempt to group non-binary people who chose to use that pronoun with inhuman AIs, somehow implying otherness for the former.
> However, English is currently not great at pronouns which signal neutral or unknown gender.
> Which is unfortunate.
>
> I also have no problem admitting that writing pronoun-free text which still makes sense is beyond my abilities at the moment.
>
> If my usage here is misaligned with how you choose to use pronouns around your game table, I am truly sorry.
>You should feel free to use the pronouns which make the most sense to you and your group, and should not consider my usage in these modules normative.
