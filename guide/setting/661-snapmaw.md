### Chillwater

Snapmaws are not the only machines to use Chillwater, but they do have an interesting relationship with the substance.
When left to their own devices, Snapmaws will find a "nest area" on land where they will "regurgitate" containers of Chillwater, before going back into the water to repeat the cycle.
They seem to produce an effectively unlimited supply of the substance, which could be interpreted as a byproduct of their water purification efforts.
This could imply Chillwater is not just pure liquid nitrogen, but also some additional chemical refrigerant compound, cleaned directly from the water supply, or created from the chemicals which are.
This seems a reasonable supposition, ss chemical refrigerants are often chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), which would be created from hydrocarbon fuel chemicals found in modern pollution, and presumably created as byproduct of the operation of FARO war machines.
