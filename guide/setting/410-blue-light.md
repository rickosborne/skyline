## Blue Light

Professed by the shamans of the [Banuk](330-banuk.md), the Blue Light is the animistic representation of the soul or energy present in all machines.
Blue Light represents the inherent goodness or benevolence of machines, and is dimmed or driven out by effects like Corruption or Daemonic influence.
While the Blue Light corresponds with the color of machine lighting when it is not aggressive, and is likely where the association comes from, it now represents not just the physical lighting but the intangible intent.

Blue Light is also related to the "song" of the machine, which is different between machine types.
This song is the physical counterpart to the Blue Light, and can be heard by shamans and others who listen hard enough.
Machine songs can also become recognizably twisted through Corruption or other effects.

Bluegleam crystals, found in The Cut and other Banuk lands, is seen as the materialization of the Blue Light as it departs the body of a dying machine.
In addition to being semi-sacred, Bluegleam has chemical properties which make it useful for a number of mechanical enhancements.

The tale of Banukai includes mention of her accepting the Blue Light into herself, an offer made in a vision by the machines to give Banukai the power to vanquish those pursuing the first Banuk.
The Blue Light taught her how to use machine parts to stitch her wounds with cables and metal, augmenting her abilities, but ultimately leading to her demise.
It's not clear whether this also included taking Bluegleam into herself.
