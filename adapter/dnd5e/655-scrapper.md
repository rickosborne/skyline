_**Pack Tactics.**_ The Scrapper has advantage on an attack roll against a creature if at least one of the Scrapper's allies is within 5 feet of the creature and the ally isn't incapacitated.

_**Radar Ping.**_ An electromagnetic pulse reveals all humans, machines, and animals within a 60 ft. radius, blocked only by metal walls, or stone or wood walls at least 1 ft. thick. This pulse pierces through stealth.  The Scrapper shares information gained from this pulse with all other machines within 120 ft.  Takes 60 seconds to recharge.
