# Skyline

Skyline is a set of tabletop role-playing game modules unofficially set in the world of _Horizon: Zero Dawn_.

It's a work in progress, with the goal of eventual release as a set of free modules in PDF, HTML, and potentially other forms.

A Web interface will eventually be available via:

> https://rickosborne.github.io/skyline/

You probably want one of:

* [Guides](guide) — Player and narrator guides, giving play and setting guidance.
* [Stories](story) — Narrative adventure modules of varying size.
* [Adapters](adapter) — Modules which explain how to adapt Skyline and the world of _Horizon_ to your preferred game system. 

There's also a [Notes](notes) section, which might be interesting to people who want to know more about the design process for Skyline.
