# Skyline

Skyline is a set of tabletop role-playing game modules unofficially set in the world of _Horizon: Zero Dawn_.

It's a work in progress, with the goal of eventual release as a set of free modules in PDF, HTML, and potentially other forms.

A Web interface is available via:

## Modules

You probably want one of:

| Module | Completion | Description |
| ------ | :----: | ----------- |
| [IASO](story/iaso) | **~55%** | Single-session one-shot adventure for one adventurer or a small party. |
| [Connection](story/connection) | **~27%** | Multi-arc adventure for one adventurer or a small party. |
| [D&D 5E Adapter](adapter/dnd5e) | **~20%** | Guidance for playing Skyline with the D&D 5E system. |
| [Cypher System Adapter](adapter/cypher) | **~23%** | Guidance for playing Skyline with the Cypher System, a mid-weight system which de-emphasizes dice rolls in favor of discovery. Used by _Numenara_, _The Strange_, _Predation_. |
| [Adventurer's Guide](guide/adventurer) | **&lt;10%** | Narrative-agnostic guidance for players who want to make playable characters. |
| [Narrator's Guide](guide/narrator) | **&lt;10%** | Narrative-agnostic guidance for players who want to facilitate game sessions and create their own stories. |
| [Setting Guide](guide/setting) | **40%** | Narrative-agnostic background on the world of Skyline and how it builds on _Horizon_. |

There's also a [Notes](notes) section, which might be interesting to people who want to know more about the design process for Skyline.
Data nerds might enjoy the [Data](data) section.

## Alternatives

* [Horizon Zero Dragons](http://5ezd.wikidot.com/) â€” "This wiki will eventually compile the complete rules and mechanics of the _Horizon Zero Dragons_ hack, also known as _5eZD_, which makes it possible to roleplay in the world of _Horizon Zero Dawn_ and _Horizon Forbidden West_ using the current edition of _Dungeons & Dragons_."
  
  At this time (2020-08), 5eZD is more complete than Skyline.
