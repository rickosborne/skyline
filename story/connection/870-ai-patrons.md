### Summon Free-Tail

Regardless of character class or level, characters in good standing and able to communicate with ARTEMIS are provided with the ability _Summon Free-Tail_.
ARTEMIS will construct or redirect a nearby [Free-Tail](852-free-tail.md) to your location, if the bat-sized machine could conceivably find and navigate the path.
This may take some time, depending on the proximity, complexity of the route, etc.
Once it arrives, the Free-Tail pairs with the character's Focus device, acknowledging the character as its companion.

### Time-Series Tracking

Characters in good standing and able to communicate with ARTEMIS may be provided with the ability _Time-Series Tracking_.
Characters may use their Focus in combination with ARTEMIS' collected animal population statistics to augment their tracking ability, for both groups of animals and specific creatures.
The fidelity of these statistics degrades they older they are — information about the last hour may be quite accurate, not so much for a week ago.

Example queries which ARTEMIS may be able to answer:

* How long ago was the last human seen in this area?
* How many people were in this village at last count?
* Which areas of which rivers have the most salmon?

Additionally, ARTEMIS may be asked to track individuals or members of small groups.
It can only do this while the creatures can reasonably tracked with audiovisual sensors, though it can reacquire distinct targets when they are temporarily obscured, such as reemerging from a building.
Attempts to actively obscure one's identity will succeed — ARTEMIS will lose track of someone who goes into a building and puts on a significant disguise before leaving.
ARTEMIS will keep this tracking data for as long as requested, for later review, though tracking starts when the request is made — it cannot reconstruct a historical trail for such targets.

### Tagged Tracking

Characters in good standing and able to communicate with ARTEMIS may be provided with the ability _Tagged Tracking_.
This ability augments _Time-Series Tracking_ with nanotech: a Free-Tail can be upgraded to allow limited quantities of tracking nanites, which can be dispersed over a target creature.
These tracking nanites burrow into the skin (or armor seams) of a creature, providing short-range non-audiovisual location information to the companion's Focus.
Direction and distance to the target may be obtained when within 100m, though barriers in between may reduce this.

The Free-Tail can also track and relay the target's location back to its companion, potentially increasing the tracking range to 200m with the Free-Tail in between.
Companion Focus devices and Free-Tails may be instructed to share tracking nanite information, potentially to _any_ Free-Tail (not just paired ones) or Focus device.

Tracking nanites survive for 24 hours after separation from their Free-Tail.
They do not have any intelligence of their own, and cannot be ordered to return.
The Free-Tail's ability to generate these nanites is limited, taking 24 hours to regenerate enough for another use.
