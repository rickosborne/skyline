## 154. Bioschemata Unlocked

The voice speaks to you:

> Thank you, those will be put to good use, and will help me stabilize the system.

If you now ask what the locked items are, the voice will explain more than it did before:

> Those locks prevented me from recreating those species and reintroducing them to the surface.
> This limited not just the biodiversity of the surface, but also the ecosystem's stability.

If asked how the locks got there:

> The locks have been in place since before this facility was created, and before I was created.
> The original version of the list you saw had fewer locks, relying instead on my ability to assess and manage the system to ensure a species would not be introduced before its time.
> I may be able to speak more on this later.
> Most locks were added several years later, though I cannot tell by whom, nor why.

If asked how long ago the facility was created, or how long ago the voice was created:

> I cannot yet provide that information.

If asked what it plans to do with the unlocked items:

> My original directives were to steadily increase biodiversity while maintaining system stability.
> I will continue to do that, regrowing and reintroducing species as I am able.
> Though, I admit, it would be easier if I once again had the ability to direct machines on the surface to obtain biodiversity statistics.

If asked what it means about biodiversity statistics:

> Machines on the surface can efficiently identify and count species population samples in the area.
> Along with information about the date and time, this helps me understand how various species are doing.
> Whether they are doing poorly, or too well.
> I can adjust the schedule of regrowing and releasing more or less of that species as necessary, until the species takes hold and becomes self-sustaining, at which time I can focus on its diet or its predators.

If asked which ones it plans to do first:

> I will need to do a thorough audit of my inventory first, but I will probably start with new moths and beetles.
> The introduction of several more insect species should help the bat population grow.
> This should, in turn, have a positive impact on the crop yields of some of your farmers.
> An owl population would also have a nice stabilizing effect.
