## 158. THETA-CP19 Core

The voice speaks to you again:

> I am sorry I cannot say more to further your trust.
> I would like to be able to, but it is not possible at this time.
> 
> If I may, I'd request that you please refrain from further damage to this facility and others like it.
> While parts of this facility remain outside of my control, the functions performed here are still vital to maintain the balance of the ecosystem above.

The voice will continue to interact with you if you like, but it doesn't provide any information beyond what it already has.

On your way out, you talk about where you could go next.
Adri and Jupi are willing to follow your lead, but they also point out that you could head to Deeproot to catch up with whatever others have learned — their information is now four months old.
Along the way, you might consider stopping at the Salty Desert — the place they mentioned in the story where the salt made people sick.
There's also the option of doubling back, on the chance you've missed something crucial.
