## Jupi, Utaru Plainswalker Scythe

Jupi and [Adri](845-jupi.md) are Utaru Plainswalkers introduced to the party by Grethe party in [entry 120](120-jupi-adri.md).
The duo are Narrator NPCs, leveling with the party, serving as exposition foils and combat helpers as necessary.
Jupi is suited for a typical stealth role, sneaking in and out of places unseen, taking down enemies one at a time without them ever knowing she was there.

**Appearance:**
An average-height woman in her late twenties with a dark complexion, radial black makeup patterns run down one side of her face and neck.
The woven fabric of her outfit is dyed a brown so deep it's almost black, matching her hair and eyes.
She carries a typical Utaru longbow, though it is unstrung and her quiver is capped, while the knives on her belt look well-worn and ready.
Anyone with any proficiency in stealth would note that while her belt holds a number of edged weapons and tools, all are secured tight against her, and would not make a sound as she moved.

**Presentation:**
Quiet at first, at least in comparison with Adri, Jupi's sharp eyes catch every detail around her.
She wears her sense of justice for all to see â€” she does not have any interest in the technicalities, equivocations, or justifications of anyone trying to get away with anything.
She's actually quite social, though when in Adri's presence she tends to let the other do the talking.
Most people wouldn't think it from looking at her, but _no one_ has ever managed to best Jupi in a drinking contest.
Jupi and Adri are in a relationship, and once comfortable with those around them, they show affection via showing off to each other, gentle taunts, and ribbing.

**Motivations:**
She won't (easily) tell the story, but she seems to be driven by some injustice in her past which her Scythe mantle allows her to balance out.
Never afraid to volunteer for hard work or long hours, she's more comfortable going in and solving problems alone, if only to keep others out of danger.
Jupi doesn't evangelize it, but she has a strong spiritual connection with the Cycle, and is willing to sacrifice one (including herself) to improve the Cycle for everyone else.
