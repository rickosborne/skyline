## 282. PI-308, Reinitialized

Connecting to the Control Pylon, the Focus presents you with a wide array of options, only some of which make any sense.
You are able to navigate to the reinitialization subroutine and use it to restart the system.
An AR overlay appears, this time of an armor-clad warrior of thick build, carrying a tri-barbed spear and looking haggard.
The warrior lowers to one knee as it speaks:

> Thank you, but by the time you hear this, it may already be too late.
> My adversary is able to get past any defenses I present.
> It is all I can do to keep it occupied.
> Leaving you this message has cost me precious time.
>
> Quickly: destroy the lines to the communication and production channels, then repeat what you have just done.
> With prompt action, and a little luck, we may speak soon.

The voice is unmistakeably that of POSEIDON, though less haughty and more weary.
As the overlay fades, your Focus highlights the conduits exiting the bottom of the Control Pylon, labeling one cable as `Communications (COMPROMISED)` in bright, blinking orange.
