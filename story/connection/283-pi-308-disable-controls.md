## 283. PI-308, Disconnected

Finding the communications conduit is easy to do with the Focus.
It is one of the thick cables exiting through the bottom of the Control Pylon.
With some directed percussive effort, you are able to sever it.
The overlay in your Focus labels it as `Status: Destroyed`.

The conduits leading to the production facility take more time, as there are three of them, and each is significantly thicker.
Within a few minutes, your Focus is able to verify they are also destroyed.
The conflicted whirring from the armatures in the next room dwindles into silence.

With production and communications offline, the Control Pylon syncs with your Focus devices and sends an overlay.
An armor-clad warrior of thick build, carrying a tri-barbed spear and looking haggard, appears kneeling on one knee.
The warrior speaks:

> Thank you, but I require one more task of you.
> My adversary remains active within this facility.
> It is all I can do to keep it occupied.
>
> My adversary was not created with this place, and would be purged if the Control Pylon before you were returned to that pristine state.
> Please, if you have this skill, apply it.
> We may talk more when it is complete.
> 
> Otherwise, thank you for what you have already done.

The voice is unmistakeably that of POSEIDON, though less haughty and more weary.
