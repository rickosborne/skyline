## Hooks

This module assumes the Adventurers have working Focus devices and at least one functioning Corruptor Override Controller in their possession, even if they don't yet know how to use it.
If you have not already done so, it is recommended you run through the [_IASO_](../iaso) module before this one, during which the adventurers will obtain the necessary items.

The story begins with the adventurers on their way to Cauldron SIGMA.
They've heard that the facility seemed to have stopped for a while after a visit from the Seeker, but must have reactivated, as even more Bellowbacks have been seen in the area.
The impetus to go isn't a quest with a reward, just a dire warning from Nora Braves you met around a campfire the night before.
