## 139. DELTA-4 Exit

If Adri and Jupi are not with the party, you should talk about whether you want to try to meet back up with them, and what you're going to do until then.
Either way, you know the next village is farther east along the Southtap.

You may also want to do something with the village of South Weave before you leave.
