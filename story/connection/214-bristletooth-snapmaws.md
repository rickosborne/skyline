## 214. Northeast Bristletooth

The Snapmaw presence at this end of the lake is significant.

Resolve a group Stealth check of Moderate difficulty to avoid attracting their attention.
If you fail, resolve an encounter with a number of Snapmaws equal to the number of player characters in your group, with a maximum of four.
These Snapmaws are old and already damaged, reducing their health by a third.
Any explosions during the encounter will draw a second group of the same size and reduced health.

The end of the finger lake tapers off into a twisty, lazy stream to the north.
Searching the area, you find a familiar-looking door set in a depression behind a small hill.
Your Focus labels it as `PI-271 (offline)`.

Investigating the door, you find it has no power and does not respond to attempts to open or override it.
Using your Focus to trace the power lines, you see that each end of the door's housing is still exposed to the open air, with enough dirt and debris to hint that it's been this way for many years.
The gashes in the metal to either side could easily be from Snapmaw claws.
Both door actuator mechanisms and power conduits have been thoroughly destroyed with no hope of repair.

From what you can gather with your Focus devices, the shaft behind the door seems to extend deep underground.
No signals or electrical power emanate from anywhere in the area.
This facility seems like it has been abandoned for years, with no way of getting inside.
