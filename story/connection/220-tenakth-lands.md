# Southwest

For whatever reason, the Tenakth lands to the southwest feel like the next step on your journey.
The frown you get from Rethi is a mixture of disappointment and concern, though the arch to her brow betrays at least a small measure of curiosity.

If you do not have any Tenakth in your party, Rethi and Hendli will warn you to be on your guard against a people they see as treacherous and carelessly aggressive.
While neither truly believes the Tenakth are the savages they are mythologized to be, nor can either come up with anything positive to say about them.

If you do have any Tenakth in your party, both Executors will hold back their opinions, instead offering up simple wishes of good fortune.

Rethi suggests you travel back toward Tapwash, helping any people you can along the way.
An old trail south from there used to hug the foothills before cutting west to a large ruins of the Old Ones.
She's not sure whether the trail is still used — she's doubtful — but taps her temple and points to yours, saying she expects you'll find your way.

Hendli begins to say something about heading west from Tapwash, but Rethi interrupts him:

> You would be wise to avoid the mountains west of Tapwash.
> Especially the Stormbird's Spine — a line of peaks visible from the village.
> The name is not a coincidence.
> If the machines do not tear you apart, the wind and lightning will.

Hendli scowls and moves to the back curtain, digs through bins, and returns with a half-dozen carved boar tusks, each bearing intricate designs which repeat the same broken triangular shape.
Adri accepts them as Hendli explains to the rest of you that the chits are markers given out by Executors and accepted as readily in Deeproot as shards or any other currency.
They would enable the group to get enough supplies to get at least as far as the Southtap.
He warns, however, that the markers do not go as far as they used to, especially in return for weapons or armor, and encourages you to worry about food and travel supplies first.

Depending on the haggling skills of the party, the markers will be sufficient to get some decent but gently used camping gear, repairs to any reasonable clothing or armor, and enough food and fresh water to last approximately two weeks.
If the party wants to get creative and lash a mount to a cart or wagon (once they are outside the city), one can be obtained for half the markers.

Any number of odd day-jobs or multi-day work barters can be found within the city, if you would like to gain some additional shards or trades.
