## 121. Southern Embrace Gate

Unlike the other two gates, this one seems to be intact and untouched.
It is also, however, unguarded.
The burned-out husk of a nearby fire pit hasn't seen use in weeks, leaving the smell of this place as vaguely domesticated, but slowly returning to nature.
A slight sweet and sour smell leads you to a cache of moldering fruit and carrots, hanging abandoned in a bale near one of the loopholes.
A half dozen arrows can be found wedged in between the logs of the gate.
Beyond the occasional breeze and background hum of insects, the area is nonthreatening and silent.

It takes a few minutes to figure out the system of ropes, pulleys, and counterweights to open the gate itself, and then several more to figure out how to close the gate from the other side.

It might be a trick of the mind, but the air on the east side of the gate feels a little warmer and drier, and smells less of the ever-present pines of the Embrace.
The road here branches north and south to go around the mountain straight in front of you.
The northern path, after a few hundred paces, seems more overgrown and disused.
To the south is not much better — while the road has seen enough activity to stay packed, it clearly has not seen constant use by parties of Nora Braves, as do the roads within the Sacred Lands.

There is no Utaru presence here — no matching gate or outpost, nor signage, nor anything to indicate you've stepped into Plainsong.
Once you've gotten a few minutes away from the Nora gate it disappears behind the rocks of a curve, leaving you on an otherwise unmarked valley road.
