## 159. THETA-CP19 Restored

After resetting and restarting the subsystem labeled `Machine Production`, its status changes to `CONFIGURING`.
The voice speaks to you again, this time appearing as a glowing fuchsia hologram in the center of the room.
It takes the shape of a four-legged animal, though one you have never seen before, with the powerful muscles of a predator, in a lithe form.
It looks disturbingly like a Sawtooth covered in golden fur.

> Thank you, friends.
> I can now introduce myself: my name is ARTEMIS.
> This facility, and others like it, were designed to gestate and introduce species into the local ecosystem.
>
> The bioschemata you have unlocked will allow me to greatly increase biodiversity and ecosystem stability.
> If you have any interest in helping to guide the selection of new species, you would be most welcome.
> While my animal husbandry and behavioral data for most of the non-pioneer species still seems limited, I can make educated guesses for many or most of them.

If asked how this process would work:

> We would have conversations, as we are doing now, to help me get a sense for what your people are ready for, or might want to see in the world around you.
> I still have extensive knowledge of inter-species relationships, not just between animals, but also with the plants and larger ecology of an area.
> With your help, we might push for more species which might be of help while farming, or cooperative hunting, or companionship, and so on.
> As new species are introduced, the machines produced in this facility would be able to measure their population health along with the balance of the biome, informing our future decisions.
> If certain combinations would be counter-productive, we can have discussions about alternatives or long-term management plans.
