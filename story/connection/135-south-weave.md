## 135. South Weave

South Weave sits just outside a fork of the Southtap, where the smaller branch curves off to hug the start of a range of hills to the southeast.
Another mesa, not unlike Hawk's Song, lines the north end of the valley, this one running east-west and longer than the eye can see.
South Weave is a trio of hills surrounded by flat farm land along the river and in every direction.

Even from a distance, it's clear something is wrong with South Weave.
Log spikes have been driven into the stony ground, forming some kind of rudimentary and completely ineffective defense.
It takes a moment, but you realize the logs were taken by tearing down most of the buildings which should make up the town.
The only buildings still standing are the watchtower on the north hill and a few small storage sheds, barely more than sturdy tents.
