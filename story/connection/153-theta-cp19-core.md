## 153. THETA-CP19 Core

TODO: Big monster battle (Tramplers)

As the Control Pylon ascends from within the floor, the voice speaks to you through the Focus:

> I am constrained from guiding your efforts with the Control Pylon.
> I can, however, express regret that the biodiversity outside is not what I would like it to be.
> Also, I am sure our friendship could prove to be quite productive, if we just had a clean sweep and restarted from there.

Interfacing with the Control Pylon, you are presented with dozens of other interface options.
Some, like `Doors`, are clearly subsystem controls, while others mean nothing to you.

The controls labeled <span class="spoiler">Bioschemata</span> and <span class="spoiler">Machine Production</span> seem like they could be the ones the voice wanted help with.

The `Bioschemata` subsystem has hundreds, possibly even thousands, of individual sub-items, most with words you can read but don't recognize.
Two of the items toward the top are somewhat intelligible:
 
> Tadarida brasiliensis (Mexican free-tailed bat) \
> Sympetrum semicinctum (band-winged meadowhawk dragonfly)

Flipping past the top several dozen items, looking for other animals you recognize, you note that after a point the items are all listed as `LOCKED`.
Unlocking the items, whether one at a time or in bulk, seems to be an option provided by your Override Controller, but it's not clear what would happen.
Controls are also available to `DELETE` the items, but again with no indication of what would happen.
Asking the voice does not yield a clear or helpful answer.

If you delete any items:

{:.spoiler}
> Please stop that.
> You're only hurting yourselves.
