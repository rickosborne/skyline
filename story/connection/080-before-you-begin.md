## Before You Begin

This adventure module assumes a few things.

### Players should have done

* **Players should have at least skimmed through the [Setting Guide](../../guide/setting).**
  That guide gives a general sense of the minor changes _Skyline_ makes to _Horizon_ lore, and provides a high-level overview for players who have not played _HZD_ or don't remember it.
  Don't worry about memorizing the fine details.

* **Your table has played through, or is at least familiar with, the [IASO adventure module](../iaso).**
  This isn't _required_, but it is _recommended_, as it sets up the post-_HZD_ _Skyline_ lore for the Nora.
  Your party _does not_ need the IASO module from that adventure, though having it might provide them with some additional (but not game-changing) lore opportunities.

### Characters should have done

* **Your party has acquired at least one functioning Focus device.**
  For narrative simplicity, it would be better if all party members had one.

* **Your party has at least one Corruptor Override Controller.**
  This is the piece of technology from a downed Corruptor that allows you to override machines, Cauldron doors and control pylons, etc.
  You get one of these at the end of the IASO module, without having to fight a Corruptor.
  If you've not played through the module, merchants selling parts after the Battle of the Alight are likely to have some, even if they don't know what they are.

### The table should do now

As a group, you should decide some things:

* **Why are you together, as a party?**
  Do you have a shared goal, a shared history, a shared circumstance, or something else?

* **How much have characters figured out about Override Controllers?**
  Have they figured out how mounts work?
  Have they gone through their first Cauldron?
  Have they tried accessing ELEUTHIA-9 or other ruins where an Override is necessary?

* **How open are characters about their use of Focus and Override technology?**
  Remember that some people fear the technology of the Old Ones, and will react very negatively to seeing you with it, or using it.
  Others will be covetous of it.

* **How open are you about what you learn about the terraforming technology running amok in the world?**
  The more you learn about the history of the Old Ones, the more it will show cracks in the various cultural views of history.
  How confrontational will you choose to be about that?

The answers to these questions will likely evolve as you play.
What you choose right now does not need to be fixed in stone, but having the conversation up front can help the party start off on the same foot.
