# North

Continuing your journey north, into Ban-Ur, seems like a reasonable next step.
Hendli seems pleased with this choice, and while Rethi would have liked to see you stay local, she encourages you to take your time, and continue to investigate in Plainsong along the way.

If you do not have any Banuk in your party, Hendli will provide a brief overview of the geography of Ban-Ur, at least as far as he's been told of it.
A raised circular stonework near the stove comes up to hip-height, roughly as big around as one might make by circling their arms.
It's filled with a course, red and black sand, tamped down with indentations of kettle and pot bottoms.
Hendli picks up a simple length of squared wood leaning against it and smooths the sand to a flat surface.
With quick movements of a smaller stick, again conveniently accessible and worn from use, he draws a map of Plainsong and Ban-Ur.

> The Northtap is generally considered the official boundary of our lands, though you'll find mismatched settlements on either side.
> We've never had any reason to dispute the borders, especially since most Banuk prefer the mountains to the west.
> They used to not venture farther east than the Northstalk, which I believe they call The Sand's Edge.

Hendli points to a squiggle almost due north from Deeproot, looking to be several weeks of travel from here.
It also looks to be just as far from The Cut as Deeproot is from Meridian, making for more than a month on the road.

The Northstalk is the Utaru name for the system the Old Ones would call the Missouri River and Lake Sakakawea.
The Northtap was the Niobrara and Sweetwater Rivers, which see significantly more flow than they did before.

Hendli continues, drawing ever more lines and squiggles:

> Following the Northtap due west puts you between the mountain ranges which define the north end of Nora lands and the south boundary of The Cut.
> The Carja maintained a heavy presence here during the Red Raids, though in their absence I understand the valley has been taken over by bandits.
> With the decimation of the Nora by the Shadow cult, I can't imagine it's gotten any safer.

He pauses for breath, frowning.

> If Ban-Ur has a capital city, the Banuk don't talk about it.
> The few shamans we see seem to come from the northwest around here, not from The Cut, so there may be a settlement in there somewhere.
> But I'm told that area is unforgiving in the winter, with ice storms that take days to traverse or wait out.
>
> I'm sorry I can't offer more help.
> Banuk willingness to talk of Ban-Ur has frozen over since the Red Raids and the, um, creation of The Cut.

While he is talking, Rethi moves to the back curtain, quietly lifts a lid on a bin, and returns with a half-dozen carved boar tusks, each bearing intricate designs which repeat the same flowing curves of water or wind.
Adri accepts them as Rethi explains to the rest of you that the chits are markers given out by Executors and accepted as readily in Deeproot as shards or any other currency.
They would enable the group to get enough supplies to get at least as far as the Southtap.
She warns, however, that the markers do not go as far as they used to, especially in return for weapons or armor, and encourages you to worry about food and travel supplies first.
Warm clothes and climbing gear will almost certainly be needed, though it might be easier to acquire those along the Northtap.

Depending on the haggling skills of the party, the markers will be sufficient to get some decent but gently used camping gear, repairs to any reasonable clothing or armor, and enough food and fresh water to last approximately two weeks.
If the party wants to get creative and lash a mount to a cart or wagon (once they are outside the city), one can be obtained for half the markers.

Any number of odd day-jobs or multi-day work barters can be found within the city, if you would like to gain some additional shards or trades.
