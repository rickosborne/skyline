## 213. The Ruins at Bristletooth

The ruins are, as Neffin said, nothing too special or interesting.
Only hinted outlines of buildings can be seen, nothing more than waist-high.
Rusting metal carts, not even useful as scrap, line the desiccated remains of too-straight roads.
The jungle on the far side of the river has not made it here, leaving most of the damage to wind, rain, and time.

At the far east end of the isthmus, it looks like a road led to a bridge to the other side of the river.
Only a gently-curving line of disturbed flowing water shows what once was.

From the far side of the river, what might have been a 20-minute walk across that ghost of a bridge, the rhythmic, barking cries of Snapmaws are unending.
Even from here, it is obvious there must be dozens of them.

It's hard to tell with the flow of the river, but the dark shapes you see moving up- and down-stream in that direction are likely machines.
Observing this for a while, you manage to catch sight of a grime-encrusted Snapmaw climbing over the underwater remains of the ancient bridge, before dropping back into the river and continuing north.

If you spend time tracking the movements of them machines, or have your Free-Tails do it for you, you find that Neffin's assertion seems to be correct: the Snapmaws here seem active on the northeast and south sides of the lake, with occasional traffic between the two, but they seem completely uninterested with the northwest side, or the village on its banks.
