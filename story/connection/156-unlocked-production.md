## 156. Production Controls

The `Machine Production` option is more obtuse: it is labeled as `DELEGATED` without any further explanation or details.
Your Controller interface provides options for `SUSPEND`, `RESET`, and `RESTART`, without explaining what would happen for each.
Again, the voice is not helpful here.

If you suspend production, the voice will respond:

{:.spoiler}
> An understandable choice, given your position.

If you restart production without resetting first:

{:.spoiler}
> Only a temporary respite, unfortunately.

{:.story-links.story-links-one}
[If you reset and then restart production, go to entry 159.](159-unlocked-reset-restart.md){:.story-link.story-link-if}
[Otherwise, go to entry 158.](158-locked-no-reset.md){:.story-link.story-link-else}
