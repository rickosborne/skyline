## 150. Sparkling Shores

The glowing white plain can be seen from small hills along the Southtap.
In the sun, parts of it are almost painful to look at, causing you to shield your eyes.
It would look supernatural, but the heavy scent of salt and baked mud make it clear this was once part of the riverbed itself.
The sight is impressive, continuing for several kilometers.

If Adri and Jupi are with you, they will tell you about your destination:

> Neither Scythe has been to the village but, but many in Deeproot know of it.
> Sparkling Shores was founded a few decades ago, just on the south end of a smaller salt flat like this one.
> This one is the second largest, with the largest being a few kilometers more down the river, and then Sparking Shores a few more kilometers beyond that.
>
> Salt being as crucial as it is for preserving meats, it is quite values in the markets of Deeproot.
> For a very long time, it was collected via solar stills, which of course yield low quantities very slowly.
> Travelers along the Southtap had known for quite some time about these salt flats, but as we are still 200km from Deeproot, making the five-day journey carrying heavy salt seemed impossible.
>
> Someone tried, many years ago, setting up an operation in another salt flat some 90km east of here, and days closer to Deeproot.
> After lugging dozens of sacks back to Deeproot, they soon found that the salt from that place made people sick, and gave an oily sheen when mixed with water.
> No one could figure out how to separate the oil from the salt, so the venture and that place were abandoned.
> If you see a Deeproot Utaru squint at you and rub their thumb and forefinger, it means they do not trust what you say, that you are trying to sell them oily salt.
>
> Much later, as the population of Deeproot began to grow, demand for salt continued to drive the price up and up, until it was worth more by weight than the rarest machine part or the finest art.
> A young Utaru man named Kurlan, who had thought he might journey to South Weave to seek an apprenticeship, traveled the Southtap and stopped, as we have done, to stare at this salt flat.
>
> Kurlan, who was better at math than at weaving, realized that if he dumped everything out of his pack and filled it with salt, he could live for a year or more on what he got for it.
> Like any Utaru who has spent in time in Deeproot, he knew to add this salt to water to check for an oily sheen.
> The salt seemed clean, so he made his journey back, and did indeed make enough profit to live easy for a year.
> Each year he returned, refusing to tell anyone where he was getting the salt, and developing elaborate methods of disguising where he went.
>
> Kurlan kept his secret for many years, until he started to feel the long trip in his bones more and more.
> Wanting to retire, he convinced several of his closest friends and family to come with him and set up a small village: Sparkling Shores.
> From there, they could harvest the salt and pay others to make the trip for them.
>
> Kurlan and his cohort did have one problem, however: the largest salt flat includes salt dunes that Glinthawks use as a roost.
> They lacked the weapons and skills to reliably take down the Glinthawks, and felt like they would almost certainly return in force if driven off.
> The path between this flat and Deeproot passes through forests that are quite rough in parts, adding even more time and danger to the trip.
> So they chose the smallest flat, where they hoped the Glinthawks would take less notice, and they could navigate around the thickest parts of the forests.

Against the featureless flat landscape you catch sight of swooping Glinthawks in the distance.
