## Spinner

A tarantula the size of a boar, these machines are common in cauldron production facilities on the frontiers.
They get their name from the strands of machine cabling they produce from their hindquarters.
Like a real spider, they are able to quickly affix multiple lengths of cabling to the machine they are assembling, skittering across all parts of its surface.

Spinners have no offensive or defensive skills or structures, and will flee any conflicts.
These machines have very limited decision-making capability, though their sensors are tuned for up-close fine detail, and may pick up on things most other machines would not.
They will not see humans as hostile unless they, or other machines within range, are attacked or threatened.
