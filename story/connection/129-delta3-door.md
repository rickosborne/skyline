## 129. DELTA-3 Laboratories

You notice that the door on the south wall which refused to open before can be overridden.
The voice will ask you to stop, repeating that the equipment is delicate, and that the area is no concern of yours.
Opening the door reveals a dark tunnel, 10m wide, with bends in the distance preventing you from seeing how long it goes.
Rarely, a hover cart flies along overhead.

Following the tunnel for 3km, you come to a matching door and energy grid.
As before, this door will not open to you until you override it.

Opening the door reveals another laboratory with the same setup as before, including the 3 Stalkers and 6 Shell-Walkers.
The machines all immediately go on alert and begin searching for you, but there are enough containers and other items within reach of the door that you have a chance of evading them for the 5 minutes it takes for them to return to their normal sentry mode.
The control pylon in this room does not offer up anything more than the one in the other room.

Mirroring the layout from before, a door in the southeast wall leads to a short tunnel, which in turn leads to the open-air storage and ramp column for the mesa.
Another three Shell-Walkers are working here, doing the same container-packing as before.
Another door is visible here, again in the southeast wall.

It takes a moment to realize, but there are signs here of human presence â€” a dusty shoe-print in a corner, the discarded corn husks that might have been the wrapper for a hand-meal, an Utaru woven fabric draped over a container.
You don't see anyone here, nor do you hear any voices.

If you ask the voice about the human presence, it will only tell you it is no concern of yours.
