## Heading north into Ban-Ur

The story progression in Ban-Ur could be summarized as "check your assumptions".
It presents a series of vignettes which follow a common pattern:

1. The group sees an opportunity to play heroes.
2. In doing so, the group causes some collateral damage which, at the time, seems justified and reasonable.
3. The group is presented with a gentle suggestion that there may not be a happily ever after.
4. The ramifications of the group's assumptions, decisions, and actions are shown to be exactly the opposite of what they thought.
5. The group has to work to fix what they broke.

This path is especially useful for knocking any know-it-all players down a peg, or for establishing how your world of _Skyline_ departs from the black and white canon of _HZD_.

This path allows the party to deepen their relationship with ARTEMIS, and to encounter another instance of DEMETER.
While there's no explicit meeting with CYAN, the party will likely end up in The Cut, and may want to drop in for a visit.

### Story elements

This arc introduces a new Banuk werak: "The Light Beneath".
Members of this werak are distinct for two reasons:

* As soon as they can walk, all members of the werak are tattooed from temple to collarbone, down the right side of their faces, with an individually unique design.
* The machines in the area do not attack them, and often serve as beasts of burden.

{:.aside}
The name is a reference to the story of Banukai in the cave, meeting the machines.
But it's also meant to imply the passion and drive in all of us, just below the surface.

It takes a while to uncover, but these Banuk know almost as much about the true history back to the Old Ones as the Seeker does.
This has allowed them to establish active relationships with isolated instances of ARTEMIS and DEMETER.
The two are generally benevolent and uncorrupted, regretful they lack the bioschemata to reestablish a more diverse ecosystem.
A balance has been reached: the humans do not hunt the machines for parts, while the AIs are able to assert enough control over the machines to allow the humans to use them to improve the ecosystem.

Conflict comes in the form of outsiders, including the adventurers.
The tattoos are designed by Banuk, but are implanted by the AI duo.
They mark the wearer as friendly to machines, allowing the latter to stay in a constant "retaliate only when provoked" mode.
But if a marked human is near a machine when it is destroyed, the protection is rescinded: the tattoo shifts to a bright red, machines will attack on sight, and they will actively hunt down "the betrayer".
If the betrayer can make it to ARTEMIS and DEMETER in one piece, they might plead their case and get the mark restored.

But to be clear: the people of The Light Beneath **want** the relationship to work the way it does.
They enjoy the benefits of machine labor, they choose to better the world around them, and the tattoos are a visual covenant to treat every part of that world with respect.

The story progression plays out as the fracturing of this relationship by the adventurers, with ramifications to the werak, the reveal of the truth, and the restoration of balance.

### Keeping the pace

This story moves rather fast on its own, once it gets going.
While the reveal of the twist takes some time, each step along the path comes with clear ramifications and next steps.

### Along the way

### The big bad

Hints are dropped early on which imply DEMETER will be the big bad, or maybe some corrupted version of ARTEMIS.
While the former will play a substantial role, mostly as an evolving mini-boss, the real antagonist(s) here will be the party themselves.
Similarly, the big bad could be said to be the opportunists who move into the power vacuum created by the party's chaos.

But really, it's the player characters.
