## 125. The Foot of Hawk's Perch

The glowing blue lights of more than a half-dozen Glinthawks are visible from the small valley at the base of Hawk's Perch.
They are active, rotating through search patterns that see two of them at a time flying away in loops before returning to the peak.
The machines will notice any sleep-walking characters within range, lights going yellow as they investigate, but they will not attack those characters without further provocation.
The Glinthawks can sense something about the sleep-walking characters which identifies them as non-threatening.

{:.aside}
Hawk's Perch is the Utaru name for Fisher's Peak Mesa, just outside of Trinidad, Colorado.

If a sleep-walking character is awoken within range of a Glinthawk, the Glinthawk will notice and consider the character a threat, attacking it as normal.
Similarly, any non-sleep-walking characters will immediately be considered threats.

Sleep-walking characters will approach the mountain, making their way toward the south end of northernmost mesa, where it joins with the larger mesa to the south.
Observant characters will notice a path worn by some amount of machine foot traffic.
This path eventually leads to the familiar doors of a cauldron.

If a sleepwalker approaches the door, it will automatically open for them.
Otherwise, the door will need to be overridden to enter.
