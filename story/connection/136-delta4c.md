### 136. DELTA-4/C

Once atop the mesa, you are presented with a similar Garden situation, this one with at least four distinct entrances.
You don't see any humans up here, and the Garden looks like it has been overgrown for years, or decades.
Some Glinthawk- and Stalker-shaped claw marks in the dirt seem like they could have been attempts to use those machines for tending the plots.
You Focus is able to find the Cauldron entrance through the foliage, labeling it as `DELTA-4/C`.

Entering the Cauldron from here reveals the exact same layout as the previous Cauldron: a corkscrew shape of the same dimensions, descending almost a kilometer straight down.
As before, a trio of Glinthawks fly up and down the column, ferrying items and containers to and from storage along the paths.
Ramps conceal you from the Glinthawks as long as you're quiet.
