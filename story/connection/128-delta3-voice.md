_For additional (spoiler) Narrator details on this conversation, see [entry 821](821-delta3a-voice.md)._

The voice communicates only through your Focus devices, with no holographic presence.
It has a neutral tone, without any particular accent or emotion.

> You should not be here.
> This laboratory contains delicate equipment, integral to reestablishing the plant life of this area.
> Please leave, so my work can continue.

The voice does not identify itself, and any attempts to ask its identity, or to ask where the voice is coming from, will be met only with:

{:.spoiler}
> That is not your concern.

If asked what the room or its equipment does:

{:.spoiler}
> These devices allow me to make new kinds of plants without having to wait seasons for them to grow and bloom.
> I can make changes to the seeds and sprouts, to try to get bigger fruits, stronger trees, and more.

If asked why it needs to do this:

{:.spoiler}
> More diverse flora representation makes the ecosystem stronger as a whole.
> The more two types of plants diverge, the less likely both will be affected by the same diseases.

If asked about what's on the mesa above:

{:.spoiler}
> These devices can only do so much, and can only tell me some things about how a plant will grow when put in the ground.
> The Gardens above are the compliment to this lab, proving out my theories and efforts before my plants get sewn into the places around here.

If asked about Hybrid `R77YU9`, Medicinal Hintergold: 

{:.spoiler}
> Do you like that one?
> I am quite proud of it, but I have also improved on it considerably with newer varietals.

If asked what else it is working on:

{:.spoiler}
> I have many lines of investigation at the moment.
> Even though I hope to continue my work for some time, it can be difficult to choose which to try next.

If asked how long it has been working:

{:.spoiler}
> That is not your concern.

If asked about the Glinthawks:

{:.spoiler}
> They distribute the seeds and other material to machines in the area for planting.

If asked about what's behind the door:

{:.spoiler}
> That is not your concern.
