## Glowcap

An ocean-dwelling machine whose mushroom-shaped top floats on the surface, extending its intricate fern-like tentacles below to filter Blaze, Chillwater, and other contaminants from the surrounding waters.
When extended and active, the filtering process in the tentacles causes them to glow a soft but bright pink.

Most Glowcaps are the smaller variety: the floating component just over a meter in diameter, tentacles which can reach 10m, and one canister each of Blaze and Chillwater.
Glowcaps built for deep sea work have storage roughly equivalent to a Bellowback's tank, and may have a reach of 100m or more.

Glowcaps can dive and submerge for extended periods of time, running off the power from collected Blaze.

Not generally aggressive, Glowcaps are able to defend themselves.
Their tentacles can be overloaded to produce Shock damage, though this also causes damage to the appendage.
On the surface, they can release Blaze into the surrounding waters, which their tentacles can ignite.
They cannot launch Chillwater attacks (like a Snapmaw might), but they can use it to flash-freeze chunks of water into ice, which they can then hurl a large distance.
The filters on their tentacles are made of fractally-fine wire arrays, and would be quite damaging to human flesh and clothing.

If a character has learned how, Glowcaps may be overridden and mounted.
They are buoyant enough to support fully-encumbered humans, though not most other machines.
Their filters can help keep them stable in the waves, but as they cannot lift their tops out of the water, riders may still be at the mercy of rough seas.
Riders should also consider some way of lashing themselves to the machine â€” grabbing a tentacle is not an option due to the sharpness of its filters.
