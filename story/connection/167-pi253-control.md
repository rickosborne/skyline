## 167. PI-253 Control Restored

Interfacing with the Control Pylon as power is restored shows a running log of events:

```

```

The system also contains the override code for Snapmaws, obtainable by anyone who interacts with it.

If you have a Free-Tail, or otherwise have learned how to properly identify yourself within a Cauldron, continue with entry 168.

Otherwise, the Cauldron remains silent.
