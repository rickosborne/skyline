## 145. Hanuli's Heel

If Jupi and Adri are with you as you travel, they will tell you a story about your next destination, Hanuli's Heel:

> Hanuli and Gurd were merchants in Deeproot, generations ago, building and selling wooden furniture.
> Across the street from their workshop was a stall selling nuts and spices, upwind so that Hanuli and Gurd worked all day to fine, savory smells.
>
> As they got older, and younger hands were able to produce items cheaper and faster, especially with the help of machine parts, Gurd began to get restless.
> He convinced Hanuli they should see more of the world before it was too late â€” he wanted to see where such exotic smells came from.
> Hanuli did not have Gurd's wanderlust, but she believed he would miss the comforts of Deeproot, and would not have to accompany him very far.
>
> The couple set off along the Southtap, which had plenty of fish, fresh water, and shade.
> They had to avoid the occasional Snapmaw nest, but the level terrain of Plainsong made it easy to see them at distance.
> For two weeks they walked along the river, Gurd stopping to smell each new type of flower, or to taste the fruit of each new type of tree.
> 
> On the fifteenth day, after rounding yet another bend in the river that looked like every other, Hanuli threw her pack to the ground in front of Gurd.
> Hands on her hips, foot stamping the ground like a charging Strider, she told Gurd she refused to walk another minute.
> If Gurd wanted to spend the remainder of his days with her, they would do it right there, and no farther.
>
> Later that night, they sat around the fire, talking through what they would need to build and where.
> Hanuli's mood had softened, and she asked Gurd what they should name this new place.
> Gurd, staring into the distance across the mud of the Southtap's banks, which still held the indentations from where Hanuli had put her foot down, said the first thing that came to his mind.
>
> The couple built up a fine house, familiar as they were with carpentry, and filled it with their works.
> Travelers along the Southtap would be offered food and rest, and would note the exceptional handiwork of such a remote place.
> They would remark on such upon reaching Deeproot, to the point that travelers going west would make sure to stop there, just to see if the tales were true.
> The couple built guest houses, which they let out for very reasonable rates.
> The village sprouted from there, and is known to this day for both its comfort and hospitality.
>
> Before we left Deeproot, we heard the people of Hanuli's Heel had become paranoid, refusing to come out of their houses, or allowing anyone to enter.
> Their fields went untended, and it was feared they would starve.
