## 122. Winter's Fork

Approaching from the north, the road breaks from the dry creek bed it had been following and heads up a gentle slope toward a well-forested area.
The smell of a fishing village off to your right, and the river feeding it, become unmistakable.
Finding that river, you turn and follow it upstream.
Behind you, the odd metal and stone debris of a ruin of the Old Ones, stretching as far as you can see along the river.

Breaking through the trees, you see Winter's Fork.
It's an odd shape — split wide across the river, with a shaped earthwork between the two halves.
This place was obviously a dam created by the Old Ones to make it easier to fish, which is exactly what the people of Winter's Fork have continued to do.
The middle of the dam gapes with a large, crumbling hole from which water pours steadily.
Mismatched boulders and logs are wedged into the hole, reducing the flow by quite a bit, but even to the untrained eye it does not seem particularly stable or permanent.

A few dozen people can be seen going about their business.
Maybe a third of them are fishing, or processing the catch, which had the familiar look of the salmon abundant in the rivers of the Embrace.
Another third are involved in various leisure activities, many with children.

The clothing here is interesting — Utaru golds and blacks dominate the palette, but Nora blues and whites are also quite common.
For every three or four people seen in the woven grasses and fabrics of the Utaru, one can be seen in the furs and skins of the Nora.
A single mother with a young boy and girl, all in Oseram earth-tone stripes, play catch around a cooking fire. 

TODO: Dinner with Adri & Jupi.
