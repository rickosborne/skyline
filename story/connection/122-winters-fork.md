## 122. Winter's Fork

Approaching from the north past hours of well-maintained fields, the road breaks from the dry creek bed it had been following and heads up a gentle slope toward a well-forested area.
The smell of a fishing village off to your right, and the river feeding it, become unmistakable.
Finding that river, you turn and follow it upstream.
Behind you, the odd metal and stone debris of a ruin of the Old Ones, stretching as far as you can see along the river.

Breaking through the trees, you see Winter's Fork.
It's an odd shape — a dozen buildings split wide across the river, with a shaped earthwork between the two halves.
This place was obviously a dam created by the Old Ones to make it easier to fish, which is exactly what the people of Winter's Fork have continued to do.
The middle of the dam gapes with a large, crumbling hole from which water pours steadily.
Mismatched boulders and logs are wedged into the hole, reducing the flow by quite a bit, but even to the untrained eye it does not seem particularly stable or permanent.

There are no walls around the village, but a pair of tall watchtowers sit at either end of the dam, with a lone lookout on duty in each.
You imagine the lookouts probably spotted you on the road an hour ago or more.
Other than the very gentle incline from the road, the land here is almost completely flat for miles.
The outline of a mountain range is visible to the west, but the foothills seem to be at least another day away.

A few dozen people can be seen going about their business.
Maybe a third of them are fishing, or processing the catch, which had the familiar look of the salmon abundant in the rivers of the Embrace.
Another third are involved in various leisure activities, many with children.
No one seems particularly surprised by or concerned with your approach — you get a few nods and waves, but mostly indifference.

The clothing here is interesting — Utaru golds and blacks dominate the palette, but Nora blues and whites are also quite common.
For every three or four people seen in the woven grasses and fabrics of the Utaru, one can be seen in the furs and skins of the Nora.
A single mother with a young boy and girl, all in Oseram earth-tone stripes, play catch around a cooking fire. 

Looking around as you approach, you see a several lit cooking fires.
Unlike Nora lands, where most people eat meat only occasionally, these fires all have boar, badger, or goat roasting above them.
The smell is also sweeter than the more herb-forward aroma of Nora cooking, with an almost palpable stickiness in the air.
It helps to cover up, but not quite eliminate, the underlying tang of fish drying in the sun.

Jupi and Adri will spot you and approach, if they were not already accompanying you.
They will explain that the people of Winter's Fork are used to through-traffic between Deeproot and Nora lands.
Pointing due east along the river, Deeproot is a 15-day walk from here.
Turning to the south, Jupi points to a barely-visible white peak on the horizon, just east of which is your next destination: Tapwash.

Winter's Fork is not large enough to have a tavern or lodge — all buildings here appear to be either storage or single-family homes, with the former outnumbering the latter two-to-one.
The buildings use fewer logs and skins than you'd see in the Embrace, with more woven grasses and spun cloth, pulled aside in most to allow the breeze to pass through.

As Jupi gives you directions and the lay of the land, Adri visits the cooking fires, striking conversations with the people tending them.
She returns and guides you over to an older Utaru man and woman, each working spinning wheels powered by machines some might recognize as Trampler Hearts.
The goat on the spit looks a little overdone already, and it's giving off that sweet smell, drawing attention to some kind of glaze that's roasted into the flesh.

Adri makes introductions between everyone, explaining that Kel and Shina have a mostly-empty storage hut they're willing to rent out for the night.
They'd prefer compensation in machine hearts, but are willing to take shards otherwise.
For the right price, they'll even throw in the goat.

Kel and Shina have heard of the problems with the villages along the Southtap, but are not sure whether they believe the stories.
No one telling the stories claims to have seen anything themselves — each story has been from a friend of a friend. 
They have not had any travelers from those areas lately.
The last person claiming to come from Tapwash would have been months ago, maybe even a year.
Kel and Shina reason there could be a problem, but it's also just as likely they're doing well and self-sufficient.
There's not much in Winter's Fork to attract someone from Tapwash.
