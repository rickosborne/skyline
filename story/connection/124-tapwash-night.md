## 124. Tapwash, Night

Every night you spend in Tapwash, or within a 20mi/32km radius of it, each character between the ages of 15 and 30 should roll a d6.
If any character rolls a 1, read the rest of this entry.
Otherwise, skip the rest for now and go about the next day as normal.

{:.spoiler}
For characters who rolled a 1, at some point in the middle of the night, you get up from your bed and begin to make your way toward the south side of Hawk's Song.
Your eyes are open, and you will prepare adequately for the journey, but you will not be conscious of what you are doing.
You will ignore anyone who attempts to engage you in conversation or block your path, but you will navigate terrain, avoid machines, and make other choices as if you were awake.
If completely prevented from this goal, you will return to your bed, and will wake as normal in the morning with no memory of the attempt.

{:.spoiler}
You can be awoken from this state, by injury or by the intentional efforts of another person.
This will return you to awareness, disoriented, and with no memory of how you got there or where you're going.

{:.spoiler}
The journey from Tapwash to the south side of Hawk's Song is approximately 11mi/18km over hilly terrain â€” just over 4 hours at a walking pace.
If any characters are conscious (unaffected) when you arrive there, read [entry 125](125-hawks-song.md).
