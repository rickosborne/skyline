# 181. Rethi and Hendli

The couple lead you outside and through the streets of Deeproot.
Passers-by occasionally head toward the pair, but each one veers off and finds something better to do when they notice the pair of tall scythes trailing behind.
It's an odd sight, as the faces of the crowd still don't show fear of the Scythes â€” it's something more like a sudden desire to be absolutely anywhere else.
Other than small greetings, the group is uninterrupted on their path.

The man speaks up first, introducing himself as you walk:

> My name is Hendli.
> I am the Executor of Outlander Politics for this season, and the seventeen seasons past.
> My commission is to not just stay abreast of the lands outside of Plainsong, but also to improve how we can ensure we are never caught off guard by events abroad.

The man throws a glance to the taller woman at his shoulder, but she takes her time continuing to size up your party before speaking:

> Rethi.
> Executor of Plainsong Growth and Balance.
> I guide our people toward paths which ensure we do not over-extend ourselves or our lands, ensuring each season continues to be better than the last.

Now might be a good time to explain to the table how politics and leadership work in the city.

The cleanliness of the streets and freshness of the house-paints falters as you get farther from The Root.
It is still one of the cleanest cities you've seen, including even Meridian, but the buildings here are starting to show their age.
Rethi and Hendli stop in front of a squat stone house, which appears to have at least three living units, based on the number of doors.
The heavy wooden door has seen enough snowy winters to show layers of wear and caked grime.

Inside, the decor is open and comfortable-looking.
A central stove is used for both cooking and heating, with a woven curtain along the back offering some measure of privacy and/or storage for whatever is beyond.
There are log and hemp chairs and benches circling the stove, with seating for at least a dozen.
Shelves and bins along one wall are topped off with spices, cured meats, dried fruits and vegetables, grains, and cooking instruments of varying sizes.
It's clear the two are used to long, meal-spanning discussions with large groups.

The next two hours finds Jupi and Adri relaying everything they learned about the Shadow cult, the Battle of the Spire, the Nora Seeker, and more.
Rethi grows visibly impatient waiting to talk about Plainsong, but is also keenly interested in the Outlander events, and asks just as many questions as Hendli.
Jupi and Adri occasionally ask for your perspective on events.

Hendli and Rethi prepare a large meal for everyone, seeking input on preferences, sensitivities, etc.
Jupi and Adri help without being asked, showing they've followed this ritual any number of times.
The conversation does not slow during this time, and the activity combined with intense discussion can be dizzying for outsiders.
Another hour passes as the discoveries in Plainsong are retold.

Jupi and Adri, despite their warnings about keeping a low profile, spare no details about Focus devices, ruins of the old ones, machine mounts, or anything else you encountered along your journey here.
Rethi's smirk returns with a small nod, as if she'd been waiting for the topic to come up.
Reaching to Adri, she asks:

> May I see?

If Adri has a Focus, she will hand it over without hesitation.
Otherwise, Rethi will ask one of the party, instead.
Whether you hand one over is up to you.
If you do, Rethi will be impressed, but will hand it back after a few moments of looking around.
If not, she will keep a neutral expression and her opinion to herself.
