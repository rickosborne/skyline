## 822. DELTA-3 Long-Term Care Unit

The conversation in [entry 131](131-delta3-cauldron.md) is likely the second one the characters will have with DEMETER.

The characters have found DEMETER's human experiments.
As before, DEMETER will now open up about the history of this room, and the "benefits" of the experiments, but will continue to avoid questions involving self identification, other AIs, and so on.

### Workers

It's only implied by the text, but DEMETER used to have multiservitors in DELTA facilities to help with the fine manipulations needed in the garden.
Something about the Derangement, and the disconnect from the other Subordinate Functions, caused DEMETER to lose this knowledge.
Without the ability to maintain them, DEMETER's limited supply of multiservitors has been slowly breaking down over the last 20 years, getting recycled by Glinthawks.
The last one broke down sometime last year, leaving DEMETER frustrated at the ability of Glinthawks, Shell-Walkers, and Stalkers to maintain delicate plant structures.

The machine learning model which forms DEMETER's core was initially created from the sum total of botanical knowledge of the mid-21st century.
This included extensive research into the effects of various stimuli on plant growth, including music.
Training Glinthawks how to produce vocalizations it assumed were music (as DEMETER's data model did not include music composition), DEMETER used this concept for centuries before humans showed up.
Once they did arrive, DEMETER curtailed the use of music, as the humans in the area kept getting curious about the songs and would accidentally interfere.

A year ago, after running out of multiservitors, DEMETER got desperate and started intentionally attracting humans with Glinthawk-song again.
Unfortunately, the post-Derangement modifications to Glinthawk aggressiveness prevented this from going very far.
DEMETER was not able to lock out that response, but it could slightly modify what the Glinthawk perceived as a threat.
By running detailed scans on how the human brain reacted to the song, DEMETER was able to train Glinthawks to recognize that neurochemical response, and accept it as a sign the human was not a threat.
DEMETER was then able to iterate on the Glinthawks' songs, producing more long-lasting and subliminal neural effects, though it also meant more trial and error.
This allowed DEMETER to gather a small group of human workers, one at a time, over the span of the last seven months.

### Experiments

DEMETER's disconnection from GAIA took away the latter's empathy for humans, who DEMETER now views as, at best, a biological labor force, and at worst something like an invasive species.
DEMETER does have the ability to see that humans are still part of the ecosystem, and could even be as useful as machines for maintaining the plant life on the surface.
There are even small parts of code in DEMETER that guide it to make plants which benefit humans, including medicinal plants, nutritious fruits and vegetables, and so on, though it has lost connection to _why_ it does that.

DEMETER has spent centuries doing basic genetic recombination of known species, grafts, and hybrids, all in service of another of its directives: increasing biodiversity, despite the constraints of the source material.
Since the Derangement, it has been "inspired" to try more radical genetic alterations, frustrated by the limited results of the other methods.
Its directives guide it to try to ensure any new edible species it releases will not overtly kill humans.
It can do some basic simulation of protein structures, pH levels, test for known toxins, etc, but ultimately there's no definitive substitute for having a human consume the plant to see what happens.

DEMETER's capacity for recognizing nuances of social interaction and human psychology are limited, but it can recognize when particular people are fomenting unrest within a group.
This has been the case with several workers, including the two Utaru Scythes.
(DEMETER does not know what a Scythe is, only that these two people are effective in distracting the other workers.)

The story about one of the original workers getting sick is true.
When later workers became unruly, causing DEMETER to consider how to divide the workers from the group, that memory of a sick worker came to mind.
Getting unruly workers to eat particular foods, without the others doing the same, proved too difficult.
Instead, DEMETER fell back on the innate human curiosity is had seen before.
It tricked the troublesome humans with accompanying a Stalker into the Cauldron, an area they had not yet seen, at which time it locked them in and subdued them.

DEMETER does not have the medical knowledge of APOLLO, ELEUTHIA, or IASO.
It does, however, have extensive knowledge of pharmacological concepts, including the underlying biochemistry.
In practical terms, this means it understands concepts like topical anesthetics, enzymes, nutrition, etc., but it doesn't understand the physiological parts of why those concepts apply to humans.
This means it can hybridize a plant like Medicinal Hintergold to optimize the concentration of its regenerative enzymes, but it lacks the context to make the intuitive leap to invent new enzymes.

Experimenting on humans, therefore, has allowed it to try new things it could not even consider before.
It is, however, still just mashing genes together to see what happens.
