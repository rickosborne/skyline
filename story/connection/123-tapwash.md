## 123. Tapwash

The road between Winter's Fork and Tapwash isn't much more than the vague hint of a path, with stone piles every few hundred paces.
Navigation isn't difficult, though: keep the mountains and forests on your right, the open grasslands on your left, and keep heading south.
The occasional remains of metal and stone structures dot the land, but not enough to signify more than a building or two at a time.

A small northeast-flowing river, which Jupi points out is the Tapwash Swell, marks the final leg of your journey.
Like Winter's Fork, Tapwash is gently uphill from the flats you've traveled, though this time it is nestled in the foothills.
A large, lone peak looms to the south, with long ranges to the west, and the dual snow-capped peaks to the north which Jupi had pointed out from Winter's Fork.

The fires of Tapwash are visible on a hill (so flat it must have been leveled by the Old Ones) above another lake, approximately the same size as the one at Winter's Fork — it would likely take several hours to walk around.
This lake also has a dam of the old ones, though less sophisticated.
The shaped earth, lacking in any of the worked artificial stone of the Old Ones, looks to have broken through decades ago, if not centuries.

Climbing the hill to Tapwash, you see the village isn't much more than a half dozen houses and as many storage buildings.
The architecture style is something of a combination of Nora and Utaru: the heavy log walls of the building look like they would be good at keeping in the warmth during winter months, while the large shuttered windows are hung with the same combination of woven grasses and spun cloth.

Your approach causes something of a commotion — an older woman in a watchtower gets the attention of everyone within yelling distance, all of whom drop what they are doing and come to greet you.
Eleven adults and thirteen children stand before you.
It only takes a moment to realize no one here is between the ages of fifteen and thirty.
It could be that they are out fishing, gathering, and working, but the stares and whispers from adults and children alike make it clear there's something agitating these people.

Letting Adri take the lead, she makes introductions for everyone, explaining the task she and Jupi had been given to look into the mysterious occurrences.
This earns glances and shuffled feet from the crowd.
The oldest of the women steps forward, introducing herself as Heeli.
She confirms that their teens and young adults have gone missing — twelve in total — even the ones who chose to live in the area, and not within Tapwash itself.

Heeli also explains that Adri and Jupi are the third pair who have come from Deeproot to investigate.
The other two pairs were in Tapwash for mere days before disappearing into the hills like all the others.
One pair was last seen heading toward Hawk's Song, the mountain visible to the southeast.
The other pair seemed to have been lost to the Snapmaws at the west end of the lake — at least that's the direction they were walking.
