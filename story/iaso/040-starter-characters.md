### Starter Characters

If your players have already created their characters, skip ahead to [Chapter 1](101-road-to-mothers-watch.md).
This section contains a number of pre-made characters to help new players jump in without as much setup.
As this module is an introduction, none of these pre-made characters has any specific skills or attributes â€” you shouldn't worry too much about party composition or balance.
Players should play what seems interesting to them, and should feel free to duplicate or modify as they like.
