# Starter Characters

If your players have already created their characters, skip ahead to [Chapter 1](101-road-to-mothers-watch.md).
This section contains a number of pre-made characters to help new players jump in without as much setup.
As this module is an introduction, none of these pre-made characters has any specific skills or attributes — you shouldn't worry too much about party composition or balance.
Players should play what seems interesting to them, and should feel free to duplicate or modify as they like.

The characters here are described using gender-neutral they/them pronouns.
Players should feel free to use whatever pronouns they choose.

Each character also has questions to help the player add some emotional depth.

* [Yenever Feldspar](042-fighter.md) — _Tenakth, fighter_
* [Thorn](044-rogue.md) — _unknown, rogue_
* [Drake](046-ranger.md) — _Nora, Brave (hunter)_
* [Haldred](048-engineer.md) — _Oseram, engineer_
* [Van](050-monk.md) — _Banuk, historian_
