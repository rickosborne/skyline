## 109

Read to everyone:

> You arrive in Mother's Watch as they are closing up the main gate for the night.
> The large open forum has a half-dozen small buildings, all in the typical Nora style, and all clearly new construction.
> Piles of black ash and burned lumber have been swept to the walls, but not entirely removed.
>
> A few merchants remain in the square, trying to get in one last sale for the day, but the effort is half-hearted as they pack up their wares.
>
> You're directed up a winding hill to another open area at the foot of a mountain.
> It's bustling with activity â€” dozens of people, many in family groups, sit at long, improvised tables, sharing a meal with the weary but good-natured exhaustion of a long day's work.
> Off to the side, tables of food feature a wide variety of dishes, not all Nora.
> The sharp tang and bright colors of Carja dishes catch your eye, along with the grainy scent of Oseram sweetbreads.
>
> A family in Carja dress gets up from a table, making their way over to a crowd gathering around one of the lodges.
> You take their place to sit and eat, wedged in between what looks to be a Nora family and an assortment of tradespeople of Carja and Oseram dress.
