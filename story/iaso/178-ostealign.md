Read to everyone:

> Opening a cabinet, you find a pile of what appears to be wide, paired rings.
> Your focus labels each as `OsteAlign (adaptive orthosis)`.

Jineko, and Haldred if they are in your party, will notice that each device has a power adapter.
Jineko will pull a Watcher Heart from her bag along with a length of blue cable.
Using it to supply power to the device changes its designation in your Focus overlay:

> Two human-shaped graphics appear.
> In addition to the outlines, one has arm bones while the other has leg bones.
> On each, one bone appears broken and misaligned.
> The outline of an orthosis appears next to each, animating to show the rings slipping over the injured limbs before clamping down to the skin.
> Armatures peel from the rings, align the bones, and straighten into rods which lengthen and connect the rings.
> A small pair of lights goes red on each ring, accompanied by the bones stiching together.
> The lights go green, the rods retract back into the rings, and the rings are slipped loose from the limbs.

When unpowered, each pair of rings is approximately one hand-span wide.
When powered, the rings will expand to twice that to accommodate arms or legs.
Each pair is approximately 4lb (1.8kg).

There are five pairs of rings which seem to be in good working order, with another three which might be repairable with some effort.
