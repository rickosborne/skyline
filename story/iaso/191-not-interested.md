Read to everyone:

> Teb is visibly disappointed when you tell him you're not interested in checking on Olara.
> He shakes his head, but recovers quickly.
> "You're probably right.  She can take care of herself.  Let's grab that breakfast before we put you to work."
>
> Breakfast options are what you'd expect of the Nora: thick slabs of bacon, boiled eggs, steamed vegetables.
> Another half-dozen tradespeople accumulate around Teb as you all sit on rough stump stools.
> Introductions are made, and everyone eats quickly as Teb explains the plan for the day.
>
> "We're running low on lumber, and with the new help and the good weather, I'd like us to stock up.
> We'll spend the morning on that, then the afternoon preparing it."
>
> Teb shows you where to find tools.
> A pair of lumber carts — each not much more than two wheels and a bed — are roped together before piling on and lashing down a number of axes and saws.
>
> Teb stays in the village to help clear space before you get back, directing the others to go to the usual place.
> The morning mist is just beginning to burn off as you exit the main gate.
>
> The others wheel the cart along the road to the east, heading back in the direction toward the ruins.
> But they don't stay on the path for long, instead hugging the rocky base of the mountain which forms the natural wall of Mother's Watch.
> You travel maybe ten minutes, more from wrangling the cart than from distance. 
>
> Someone points out a half dozen trees closest to the rocks, which you can see have been marked with little strips of dyed cloth.

Along your trip, one of the tradespeople will notice the hand injury from opening the door.
You are able to explain it away as just something that happened on the trip from Mother's Cradle.
The Nora among the tradespeople, and any Nora in your party, will pause and pick some Medicinal Salvebrush berries, giving them to the injured person.

If the injured person eats the berries, which any Nora will strongly encourage, they find the wound on their hand closes up over the next hour.
Their Focus makes special note of this.
If they are wearing a Sensor Pad, the Focus overlay reveals a message stating `Regenerative enzymes detected.  Agent catalogued.` before fading away.
Otherwise, the message is `Unknown pharmacological effect detected.  Attach a sensor pad for further analysis.` and lingers before fading.
If the party brought any Sensor Pads with them, and the injured party member can do it stealthily, they may attach it while they walk, causing the Focus to give the first message.
