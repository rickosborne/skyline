Read to everyone:

> Hours into your search of the ruins, you're getting used to looking harder at each and every miscellaneous part and formless blob.
> It occurs to you to look harder at the autosuture devices originally pointed out by IASO.
> The ones attached to the MedBeds have long since become useless stalagmites from centuries of dripping condensation, but a more thorough search reveals several more secreted in cabinets, as well as a collection of spare parts for others.
>
> None seem to do anything when power is applied — their Focus overlays show a message about attaching them to a MedBed, along with an animated example of how to do so.
> Unfortunately, the attachment points on the MedBeds are all covered in stone or otherwise destroyed.
> You could probably excavate one, but the effort would take hours or even days of cautious, painstaking work to ensure you didn't damage anything vital.

Autosuture parts are heavy — the articulating cabling is dense, and the attaching surface is large enough to make you think it needs to be quite stable.
The connector does not appear compatible with the Biomechanical Neural Interface, and the two do not seem to recognize each other when connected.

<aside class="narrator-note">
<header>Narrator note:</header>
<p markdown="true">Autosutures are not critical to this story.
They are here as a "scary looking but potentially helpful" technology, which a narrator could use as a plot hook to drive some interesting conversations with the Nora, the Oseram, or even the Banuk.
Players are encouraged to seal the autosuture parts up in a crate or closet and leave them here, coming back for them later if needed.</p>
