## Author Notes

Boy howdy, I **did not** know what I was committing to when I decided to start this project.
Writing even just a single module is work enough, but then I was dumb enough to tackle multiple adapters for very different game systems, condensing an entire open-world RPG into a few pages of introductory text, and even building a module-generating system, so I could (try to) keep the whole thing consistent.

It was fun, and I would do it again, but woof.

Another thing I've figured out: trying to keep the scope to a single-session adventure is also surprisingly hard.
I have so many ideas for content I want to build in, threads I want to show, people and things I want to introduce.
With a 3-4 hour budget, however, almost none of that can be shoehorned in.
It will just have to wait until _Connection_.

Hopefully, the few threads I've been able to start will make sense, and players and narrators alike will be able to see where things could go.
