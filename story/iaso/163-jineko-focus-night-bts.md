This entry is intended for Narrators who would like some additional context on the scene in [entry 135](135-ruins-night.md).
It is not required for understanding of the story, and may be skipped!

### Scene Overview

As Jineko enters the ruins, IASO begins to speak to her through her Focus.
Even if you had IASO with you when you gave Jineko her focus, IASO would not reveal itself due to its high-level directives against interference.
Jineko's entry to the ruins allowed IASO to classify her as aware of the Old Ones, allowing it to reveal itself.

IASO would inform Jineko that the neural bypass offered by the sensor pads seems to be stable and operating within expected tolerances.
It would reassure her that muscle tone and control would improve in time, with proper physical therapy and effort.

Jineko might ask IASO if the damage could be repaired permanently.
This, and the answer, would be up to the narrator as appropriate for the group of players.

The rest of the scene plays out as depicted in the story entry.
