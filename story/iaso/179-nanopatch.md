Read to everyone:

> Cracking the seal on a crate, you see several dozen swatches of what appears to be woven metal mesh.
> It is soft to the touch, like cloth, but resists all attempts to tear, stretch, or cut it.
> In your Focus overlay, each has an AR label: `NanoPatch (not charged)`.
> The patches are of various sizes and shapes, mostly squares, rectangles, circles, and ovals, ranging from barely larger than your thumb, to the size of a stretched hand.

Jineko, and Haldred if they are in your party, will notice that each device has a power adapter.
Jineko will pull a Watcher Heart from her bag along with a length of blue cable.
Using it to supply power to the device changes its designation in your Focus overlay:

> Several things happen as the power source is connected.
> The AR label changes to `NanoPatch (charging: 0%)`, and waiting several minutes shows that number slowly increase.
> Next to it, the small outline of a human appears.
> The outline has a red gash across one arm, which the Focus zooms in on, giving it the details of an injury.
> The representation of a patch, with the AR label `NanoPatch (charged 100%)`, is laid across the wound.
> Small blue dots appear on the patch, moving into the wound, while at the same time the patch glows a faint red.
> The wound begins to close as the dots move around with some kind of activity.
> When the wound has sealed, the patch shifts from red to green and peels away from the now-whole arm.

There are eight working patches, and three more which do not react when power is applied.
Some experimentation leads you to believe that each patch would charge to 100% after 8 to 12 hours, depending on size.

Anyone applying a patch to an injury would experience a slight tingling effect, and that lacerations close instead of hours instead of days.
Similar results are seen for burns, frostbite, bruises, and other basic injuries which do not require non-dermal organ repair.
Like sensor pads, NanoPatches adhere only to skin, but become easy to remove when the injury repair is complete.
Removing a NanoPatch before this is possible, but would likely cause additional injury to lacerated skin.

<header>Narrator note:</header>
<p markdown="true">NanoPatches provide a narrative opportunity for overnight recovery of surface injuries, especially when on the road or otherwise in places where more thorough medical treatment may not be available.
More serious injuries may require an [OsteAlign (orthosis)](178-ostealign.md), [Autosuture](184-autosuture.md), or [MedBed](185-medbed.md).</p>
<p>NanoPatches need a power source because they work on the same nanite technology as the biomass converters in Deathbringers and other FARO machines.
The nanites are programmed for basic cellular repair, but are not sophisticated enough for the kinds of coordinated or nuanced large-scale repair required for major organ damage.
This restriction is intended to prevent them from being a cure-all, and narrators are encouraged to tailor them to their needs.</p>
