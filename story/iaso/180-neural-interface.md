Read to everyone:

> Recovering the OsteAlign rings leads you to notice a small handful of similar ring devices. 
> These, however, are single rings, much thicker than their counterparts.
> One especially large ring looks like it could fit around a waist or chest.
> The actuators are longer, and coiled around the ring in several thick, ropy spirals.
> Your Focus labels each ring as a `Biomechanical Neural Interface`, and they have the same power adapter interface.
>
> Supplying power doesn't produce any physical change in the ring or its AR overlay label.
> The now-familiar pair of human outlines appears, one with a partial arm and the other with a partial leg.
> Animations show the rings fitting over the limbs and constricting, the actuators uncoiling and expanding away from the ring.
> A sequence of prostheses appears, cycling through to show a number of options.
> In parallel, a prosthetic from each sequence fits to the limb, ring actuator arms snaking to lock it in place.
> The prosthetics flex and move, showing off articulation, before the animation repeats with a different limb and prosthetic combination.
>
> A search of the facility does not reveal any prosthetics as they are depicted in the animation.

Jineko, or Haldred if they are in your party, will have the idea that they could probably adapt machine parts to work, presuming the interfaces were compatible, which they probably would be.
Manufacturing custom prosthetics would likely take significant time and effort, but should be possible with an Oseram forge.

<p markdown="true">The intent here is to provide interesting narrative hooks for characters with missing limbs.
It is <strong>not</strong> intended to just make the world harder for someone.
If players would prefer to start with a reasonable prosthetic, instead of questing and experimenting, one or more could be discovered in the ruins.</p>
