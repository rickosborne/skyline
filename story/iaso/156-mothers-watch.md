### Mother's Watch

Read aloud:

> Mother's Watch is quite different from what it was even a few weeks ago.
> The Eclipse attacks killed many of the Braves, and no small number of others.
> Now, you see only a scant handful of Braves, plus another few handfuls of families and merchants.
>
> As you look closer, you see many of the families and merchants are not Nora.
> Most have Carja clothes and styling, though more sedate and somber than what you'd see in Meridian.
> A few Oseram are visible, though these all seem to be merchants and tradespeople, not families.

If you'd like to look around, you'll need the [Map of Mother's Watch](515-mothers-watch.md).

Talking with the Carja reveals most are refugees — trying to get as far from Shadow Carja territory as possible.
Some lost their homes in the attacks, while others abandoned them after losing faith in the Sun King's ability to protect them.
None of them seem particularly interested in the Nora or their culture.

Talking with the Oseram or the Nora tradespeople (there are no Banuk here) reveals that most are honest people, just trying to be helpful.
A few seem shadier, but deeper conversation reveals they've lost their homes in the attacks and are trying to figure out how to reassemble their lives.
No amount of haggling can get any merchant or tradesperson to lower their prices — these people are trying to survive — though most of them are open to trading with items other than shards.

Talking with the Nora will reveal that all are eager to help as many people as they can, and see it as only right to reach out their hands after such tragic events.
All agree that opening the Embrace was the right thing to do, but some are conflicted about this, unsure of how it will all work out, and if the Nora have the resources to help everyone in need.

Idle chatter reinforces the impression that the party shouldn't mention their delve into the cave and facility.
There's a strong sentiment against machines of all kinds, as well as a feeling that bringing up things from beneath the ground can only lead to death and destruction.
If the characters brought IASO, they take care to hide it from view, and it does not glow or speak aloud for the duration of their time in Mother's Watch.

A few people may notice the party's Focuses, but it's easy enough to pass them off as non-functioning copies honoring Aloy and her deeds.

<header>Narrator note:</header>
<p>Most people are not aware of Aloy's delves into the Cauldrons or the truth about AIs or the Old Ones.
That is, most don't have any better sense of Old Ones history than they did before the attacks.</p>
<p>Aloy was tight-lipped about her discoveries, only dropping hints of the truth here and there to very few people.
Even her ability to ride machines is already beginning to fade into mythos — most people aren't reasoning about how she was able to do it, instead chalking it up to something mystical.</p>

The farther up the hills toward Mother's Heart you go, the more refugees you see.
Each family seems to be more anxious than the last, until there's an undercurrent of barely-restrained tension at the entrance to the mountain.
It becomes obvious why you were told to come here: there are far more people here than there are lodge beds.

The pair of Brave guards posted there will not allow anyone to enter, even Nora party members.
The guards explain that Mother's Heart is being used as an infirmary, restricting entry to only family members of those being treated.
The High Matriarchs are caring for the injured, and are not available to talk.
Skilled persuaders can only get the guards to reveal that the High Matriarchs have not left Mother's Heart in over a week, as they've been working in shifts around the clock, sleeping when they can.

The guards, tradesmen, and merchants will direct the party to speak to Teb, a Nora man who is coordinating the construction of new lodges.
