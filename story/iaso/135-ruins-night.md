## 135

The cloud cover makes the entrance to the cave tricky to find, and even trickier to navigate.
Each character will need to use their System Adapter to make a check appropriate for climbing against Moderate difficulty.
Failing characters drop 15ft (5m), taking Light damage.  
Jineko will also require some assistance getting down.

Jineko mumbles to the air and waves her hands in jerky patterns for several moments, in what you now recognize as her interacting with her Focus.
If you are a narrator who would like some behind-the-scenes context for additional roleplay options, read [entry 163](163-jineko-focus-night-bts.md).

After a time, Jineko speaks aloud:

> "IASO, are there any other tools or devices here which are still functional?
> Things which are meant to aid injured or sick people?"

IASO will address everyone:

> "There may be.
> The facility's sensors are offline, so you would need to use your Focus devices to scan and identify items."

A thorough search of the facility will reveal several items, each has its own AR Focus label and story entry:

* `Osteostabilizer`, entry 178
* `NanoPatch`, entry 179
* `Biomechanical Neural Interface`, entry 180
* `Hover Harness`, entry 181
* `Wheelchair`, entry 182
* `Hoverchair`, entry 183
* `Autosuture`, entry 184
* `MedBed`, entry 185
