Read to everyone:

> The metal door in front of you looks plain and inert to the naked eye.
> Through the Focus, you can see a bright blue ring, with one quadrant in an even brighter pink, glowing in the center.
> 
> As you reach out to touch the ring, it subtly glows brighter in anticipation.
> Your hand passes through it, doing nothing.
> Making as if to grasp the pink area, you make a turning motion, like a door knob.
> The pink quadrant spins to follow the motion.
> The entire ring solidifies to a cyan before flashing out, and the door opens.

Someone will notice that the stalagmites and stalactites in the rear of the room have been broken off and knocked about.
IASO guides you into this back room.

The ancient, dessicated corpse of an Old One lays in a corner here, labeled by the Focus as Director Ellen Evans.
Characters may choose to read the associated [Datapoint](https://horizon.fandom.com/wiki/All_Good_Things...).

Along the right wall as you enter sit two large containers.
They are empty, but the dust on them has been disturbed recently.
An investigation of the boxes, a Moderate difficulty skill check, will find a single Health Potion.

On the left wall is a large unit of some kind, with a holographic interface that glows when approached, even without the Focus overlay.
IASO is interested in this:

> This is the primary interface to the facility's systems.
> It appears that a power core has been removed, so it does not have enough to power the network.
> If you will press the MAU against the unit at the indicated point, I believe I should be able to synchronize with it.

If asked what else will happen:

{:.spoiler.block}
> My MAU does not have enough power to do much more than transfer my data.

If asked what will happen if they choose not to allow it:

{:.spoiler.block}
> My only function is to provide medical assistance.
> Without my database, I'm sorry to say I will be of limited use to you.
