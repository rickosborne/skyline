### Haldred

_Oseram, engineer, she/her_

_Primary skills:_ explosives, machine adaptation

_Appearance:_ Haldred is a short woman in her late 20s, with deep auburn hair pulled back in a braid that never seems to catch a number of wiry strays, forming a red halo around her freckled face and often-sunburned pale skin.
Haldred is noticeably shorter and heftier than most women her age, with quick wit, judgmental eyebrows, and a sharp tongue.
People willing to stand close to her would find an odd but interesting smell of combustible chemicals, machine oils, and smoky metallic undertones.
She wears typical Oseram layered frocks, which conceal more pockets and tool loops than it seems should be possible â€” but somehow she's worked out a system of padding such that nothing clinks or clatters as she walks.

_Background:_ Due to a Blaze accident a few years ago, Haldred has profound hearing loss in both ears.
She was already established in her profession as an engineer, assembling custom devices from scavenged parts, but has found it increasingly difficult to contract new work with clients who see her condition as an indicator of past incidents.
She's easily bored if she has to do the same things over and over, so there was no appeal to a safe life of building the same devices for an ever-dwindling pool of loyal clients.
Leaving her parents in Mainspring, she's transitioned to work for hire, going wherever her skills are needed.

_Attitude:_ Haldred is generally positive, if snarky, and willing to lend a hand when asked.
She problem-solves through invention: there's no challenge which can't be solved with spare parts, tools, and time.
She can get testy with people who wear masks and headdresses which cover their mouths, though she's working on her patience.
That patience does not extend to people who assume her hearing loss has in any way affected her intelligence or abilities.

_Hopes:_ While she'd been hoping to reestablish her business, Haldred is starting to come around to the idea that she can have more of an impact by bringing her skills to the people who need it instead of waiting for them to find her.
She's still trying to figure out how to make her new life work, given how much has changed about her assumptions of how things would go.
She's starting to see that so much of life is the exact same, or maybe a little different, and she's cautiously hopeful that most things will turn out this way.

_Fears:_ Every social interaction with a new person begins with the fear of their reaction.
Worse is the fear that she won't have the patience to take on the labor of bridging that nebulous gap, and what that could mean for her opportunities.
She'd struggle to admit it aloud, but Haldred is torn between trying to accept her hearing loss and the vague possibility that some Old One device found in some delve will suddenly make things easier again.
