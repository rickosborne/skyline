## Haldred

_Oseram, engineer_

{:.hanging-indent}
**Primary skills:** explosives, machine adaptation

{:.hanging-indent}
**Background:** Due to a Blaze accident a few years ago, Haldred has profound hearing loss in both ears.
Already established in their profession as an engineer, assembling custom devices from scavenged parts, they found it increasingly difficult to contract new work with clients who see the condition as an indicator of past incidents.
Easily bored if required to do the same things over and over, there was no appeal to a safe life of building the same devices for an ever-dwindling pool of loyal clients.
Leaving their parents in Mainspring, they've transitioned to work for hire, going wherever their skills are needed.

**Attitude:** Haldred problem-solves through invention: there's no challenge which can't be solved with spare parts, tools, and time.
They can get testy with people who wear masks and headdresses which cover their mouths.
Haldred's limited patience is not extended to people who assume their hearing loss has in any way affected their intelligence or abilities.

**Hopes:** While they had been hoping to reestablish their business, Haldred is starting to come around to the idea that they can have more of an impact by bringing their skills to the people who need it instead of waiting for them to come around.
They are still trying to figure out how to make their new life work, given how much has changed about their assumptions of how things would go.
