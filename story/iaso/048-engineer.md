## Haldred

_Oseram, engineer_

{:.hanging-indent}
**Primary skills:** explosives, machine adaptation

{:.hanging-indent}
**Appearance:** Haldred is short, in their late 20s, with deep auburn hair pulled back in a braid that never seems to catch a number of wiry strays, forming a red halo around their freckled face and often-sunburned pale skin.
Haldred is noticeably shorter and heftier than most their age, with quick wit, judgmental eyebrows, and a sharp tongue.
People willing to stand close would find an odd but interesting smell of combustible chemicals, machine oils, and smoky metallic undertones.
They wear typical Oseram layered frocks, which conceal more pockets and tool loops than it seems should be possible â€” but somehow they've worked out a system of padding such that nothing clinks or clatters as they walk.

**Background:** Due to a Blaze accident a few years ago, Haldred has profound hearing loss in both ears.
Already established in their profession as an engineer, assembling custom devices from scavenged parts, they found it increasingly difficult to contract new work with clients who see the condition as an indicator of past incidents.
Easily bored if required to do the same things over and over, there was no appeal to a safe life of building the same devices for an ever-dwindling pool of loyal clients.
Leaving their parents in Mainspring, they've transitioned to work for hire, going wherever their skills are needed.

{:.hanging-indent}
**Attitude:** Haldred is generally positive, if snarky, and willing to lend a hand when asked.
They problem-solve through invention: there's no challenge which can't be solved with spare parts, tools, and time.
They can get testy with people who wear masks and headdresses which cover their mouths.
Haldred's limited patience is not extended to people who assume their hearing loss has in any way affected their intelligence or abilities.

{:.hanging-indent}
**Hopes:** While they had been hoping to reestablish their business, Haldred is starting to come around to the idea that they can have more of an impact by bringing their skills to the people who need it instead of waiting for them to come around.
They are still trying to figure out how to make their new life work, given how much has changed about their assumptions of how things would go.
Haldred is starting to see that so much of life is the exact same, or maybe just a little different, and they are cautiously hopeful most things will turn out this way.

{:.hanging-indent}
**Fears:** Every social interaction with a new person begins with the fear of their reaction.
Worse is the fear that Haldred won't have the patience to take on the labor of bridging that nebulous gap, and what that could mean for opportunities.

#### Personality Questions

* Has Haldred accepted their hearing loss, or do they hold onto the vague possibility that some Old One device found in some delve will suddenly make things easier again?
* How has Haldred's accident affected their engineering process?  For example, has it become more cautious or less so?
