Focus overlays are jarring for first-time users.
The augmented reality (AR) overlay adds a glow and text to several items in the room:

* A box of little metal triangles, each of which is AR-labeled `Focus`.
* A box of coin-sized metal discs, each of which is AR-labeled `Sensor Pad`.
* The half-dome, which is AR-labeled `MAU`, and `Medical Assistance Unit (Prototype)` below that.

The blinking teal ring around the MAU goes solid, followed by the AR highlight of the object changing from a dull, generic yellow to a matching teal.
A holographic label above it blinks `Starting...` for several seconds before changing to `Syncronizing...`.

The character who injured their hand on the door hears a voice in their head, or receives a text overlay.
The voice is calm and neutral in tone as it says:

> Good evening.
> You appear to have an injury.
> One moment please, while I see what we can do.

There's a brief pause before it continues, as the holographic label changes to `OFFLINE`:

> I'm sorry, but I appear to have lost my connection to my medical procedure database.
> My ability to help will be limited until that can be restored.
> Your injury doesn't appear life-threatening, but you may want to find another Healer.

The device will then switch to speaking to the entire room through the MAU:

> Hello.
> My connections are offline, but my internal clock says the year is 3040.
> Is this correct?

It will wait for a response.
After several moments, it will repeat the question via text messages pushed to the Focuses.
It will repeat this cycle until an answer is given.

Any attempts to explain the date in non-Gregorian terms (such as the reign of the Sun King, etc), will be met with confusion, with the device eventually giving up on the line of questioning.
It will continue:

> My name is IASO.
> I am a prototype for an autonomous medical assistant unit — a Healer.
> Are there any other Healers around?

If asked what the other Healers would look like:

> I'm not sure, sorry.
> I know they should have been produced after me — certainly by now.

If asked what its function is:

> My autonomous form would be capable of any number of medical procedures.
> In my current form I should be capable of medical diagnosis and health management.

If asked what is wrong:

> My medical procedure database is empty.
> My diagnostic functions are functional, and I am receiving data from your Focuses.
> I am not receiving data from anyone or anything else in the facility, as it appears the facility power is offline.

If asked how the party can help, or what it wants:

> I would like to be of service.
> If I can show you where my data storage is, could you try to get power to it?

If asked whether turning on the power will cause any problems:

> I do not think so, but I admit I am not certain.
> With power offline, my sensor capabilities are limited to what I can see through the Focus network.
> Right now, that's just you.

If asked about the range of the sensors, or Focus communication:

> I am not an expert on that technology, but I do know the last time I was active I received data from everyone in this facility, but not anyone in others.

If asked whether the party should take the MAU base unit:

> It appears I was not scheduled for reactivation, so I have not further use here.
> I would like to be of service.
> If I can be of use to you, you are welcome to take me with you.

The MAU weighs 5lb/11kg and is a little larger than a splayed palm.
If placed in a bag or hung from a belt, people will see its presence highlighted on their Focus overlay.
It is durable, but not indestructible, and cannot be repaired if damaged.

If players choose to leave the MAU behind, they will find that they can communicate with it while in the facility by saying the word "IASO" into the air.
It will then converse via their Focus.
Outside of the facility they will find that there is no answer, nor will the MAU show up on their Focus overlay.

<header>Narrator note:</header>
<p>IASO won't speak directly about GAIA or the Subordinate Functions by name — only in vague, indistinct generalities.</p>
<p>As IASO was taken offline before Zero Day, it is aware of GAIA and its own role in the Zero Dawn plan.
It is not, however, a freed Subordinate Function like HADES or HEPHAESTUS.
Like CYAN, IASO was created as an AI which was always intended to act semi-autonomously as a medical aid.
It therefore includes the high-level directives which prevent it from disclosing too much information about GAIA until it can confirm how much the characters already know.</p>
