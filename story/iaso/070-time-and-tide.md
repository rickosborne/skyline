## Representation vs Ableism

This adventure contains narrative elements intended to raise (but not resolve) questions around culture, disability, and identity.
A non-player character is introduced who is part of a culture which has strongly resisted technology, and by contemporary standards might be considered "traditionalist" or even "fundamentalist".
This character has a mobility disability, and is presented with a cache of technology implements which run the gamut from simple assistive devices to one which effectively "cures" the disability.

Two goals of this module are slightly at odds here:

* _Skyline_ is intended to be a disability-friendly setting, and this _IASO_ module introduces setting-aligned options to make representing disability as easy as possible.
* As an introduction to the _Skyline_ setting, this _IASO_ module highlights the tension between technology and the Nora in the _Horizon_ setting.

Making the intersection of disability and identity a source of narrative tension could be viewed as ableist, or inspiration porn.
The intent, however, is to prompt conversation that should already be happening:

* What does disability look and feel like in your _Skyline_ game?
* How does disability for your characters affect their sense of identity?
* How does the revelation of high-tech assistive devices affect your characters?
* How do the various cultures view people with disability?  Simple assistive devices?  Technological assistive devices?
* Would that cultural view change if the assistive devices also offered capabilities not available to people who didn't use them?

This module does not attempt to answer these questions, nor will later modules in the _Skyline_ setting.
The answers are up to you and your Narrator, if you have one.

## Historical Context

This _IASO_ module is a product of its time — late 2020.
As it is being written, representation of disability in tabletop gaming is getting better, but is still a (needlessly) controversial topic.

* Some people believe that handling of disability in game needs to be done in a setting-appropriate manner.
* Some people believe that representation and inclusion is more important, and if the "rules" of the setting need to be bent, so be it.

While the author of this module firmly believes in the latter, the limited scope of this module allows both halves to be satisfied.
This _IASO_ module provides a wide variety of options for including disability into _Skyline_ in ways that should be agreeable to even the strictest of interpretations.
As there's no way one module could account for the full diversity of human experience, the author hopes the module also provides a solid framework for improvising even more.

Outside of tabletop gaming, the disability community itself is also evolving.
Tensions between "identity-first" and "person-first" language are still high, showing off the wide variety of disabilities and views of how those disabilities interact with identity both internal and external.
This module tries to walk that line and avoid language that commits to one or the other.
You should feel comfortable using whatever language makes sense for your table.

## Authorial Context

A note from Rick Osborne, the author of _Skyline_:

> The initial sketch of the _IASO_ story came to me all at once: what would high-tech medicine look like to the Nora?
> As I started to layer on the tech we'd already seen in _Horizon_, I kept coming back to the story of Brom and Olara.
> Brom is portrayed as having dissociative events, which got me thinking about the neurochemistry of mental illness — would technology have progressed to the point that disorders such as schizophrenia could be diagnosed physiologically?
>
> Which led me to my own autism — what would that look like to a Focus device, or to a device even more specialized in diagnosis?
> Would autism even register, even with 50 years of medical device advancement?
> This got me thinking about my nephew who is also autistic, but whose case is much closer to what most people would think of as "stereotypical autism".
> Would some high-tech medical device be able to tell the difference between us, neurochemically?
>
> Which got me thinking: could the AR overlay of a Focus act an assistive device for my nephew or my younger self?
> For example, could it help us through sensory overloads, or provide guidance on facial expression interpretation?
> How would I feel if a Focus had some magical ability to make me "neurotypical" for an hour?  Permanently?
> For me, it wouldn't even be tempting, but what about my nephew? 
>
> That, of course, led me to think about physical disability.
> The questions about assistive devices and "cures" would be the same, while physical disabilities are generally easier to show and address.
> I hope you can afford me a little space for representing disability in much clearer physical terms, instead of the cognitive and psychological terms which apply specifically to me.
