Read to everyone:

> You're able to get down into the cave without much effort or risk.
> The struggling Watcher notices your presence and fires several shots from its glowing red eye.
> Without control of its neck, however, the shots go wide and are not a danger to you, impacting the far wall.
>
> The noises made by the Watcher are likely to draw attention from any other passing machines.
> A single well-placed strike would be enough to deactivate it.

Dispatch the Watcher, which is prone, restrained, and cannot attack, then continue:

> The area is dank with standing water, bat guano, and ages of decay.
> But it's also clear this place is a ruin of the Old Ones: metal archways covered in moss and dripped stone, strange lights glowing for incomprehensible purposes, and a boxy, unnatural feel to the architecture.
> Enough sunlight filters through the ceiling to make you uncomfortable about walking around above.
