Read to everyone:

> With the Striders down, you can finally make the trip back to Mother's Watch.
> Pren swears he's fine, and the Focus does not disagree, but you decide to come back another time for the remainder of the lumber.
>
> Teb is surprised to see you back so soon, quickly intuiting that something has gone wrong.
> You explain what's happened, adding on that you think Pren should take several days off.
> Teb agrees, once again stealing glances at your Focus.
>
> "What's more," he says, "I think you should spend the night in All-Mother Mountain, Pren."
>
> Pren dislikes the idea, but Teb won't give in, leading everyone in that direction.

As you walk up the hill, Teb signals to one of your party.
You may choose which however you like, though Teb would favor another Nora if possible.
He tells them to stand on the other side of Pren, supporting his weight.
Pren objects, but he's shaky enough on his feet that he's quickly overridden.

The three of you break off from the group, approaching the pair of Braves guarding the entrance.
Teb explains the situation, and they part with a worried look at the pale and sweating face of Pren.

If the member of your party is not Nora, they would give a brief pause, but allow them to enter.
Teb would explain where you are as you walk, explaining that before the attacks, non-Nora had not been inside in living memory.

Once the floor levels out, almost all available space is filled with some combination of candles, cots, stump seats, and tables.
Most cots are occupied, and while most are Nora there are a number of people with Oseram hair and clothing.
The tables overflow with jugs of water, piles of berries and what might be other medicinal plants, and folded blankets.
Several of the blankets use the same knit style and quality you saw on Olara's shawl.

The Focus overlays many of the patients with diagnostic labels.
There are broken bones, burns, lacerations, and more.
Some labels are inconclusive exhortations: `Fever likely.  Please attach sensor pads for analysis.`

Finding an empty cot, you help Pren lay down while Teb calls over another woman.
The woman wears Carja clothes, though not the usual Carja makeup or jewelry.
Teb explains the situation to her, introducing her as [Daradi](https://horizon.fandom.com/wiki/Daradi).

If the party member with Teb is Carja, Daradi may be persuaded with Moderate difficulty to give a brief anecdote of how she came to Nora lands after Aloy saved her from her brother's attempt on her life.
Otherwise, Daradi will be nice, and will be grateful, but will not divulge any of her personal history.

By this time, Pren has fallen asleep.
Teb has a moment where he's worried, but your party member and Daradi are able to convince Teb that Pren is fine.

Before leaving the mountain, Teb makes a point of walking by and pausing in front of a giant metal wall.
It's clearly an Old One structure, and the Focus overlay makes it clear it's a door with structures beyond.
The door does not react, though Teb seems disappointed by this.

Outside, Teb pulls your party away and behind a lodge, speaking in low tones:

> "You have not even been here a day, and yet we are already in your debt.
> And yet, if I am correct, that debt will only increase."

With this, he looks pointedly at your Focuses and weapons.

> "As much as we would appreciate your help fetching lumber and building lodges, I have a feeling you might do more for us if I free up your time.
> As you have already seen, not everyone is ready for more change, though some are.
> Find me if I can be of any aid to you."

Teb thanks each party member individually, before heading back down toward the main gate.
