### Yenever Feldspar

_Tenakth, fighter_

_Primary skills:_ melee combat, intimidation, strength, endurance

_Appearance:_ Towering over most, broad-shouldered, and thick-framed, Yen is a wall of solid muscle.
Where many [Tenakth](https://horizon.fandom.com/wiki/Tenakth) would prefer a base of blue body paint and red mouth and neck, they have replaced the red with white, covering almost all the bronze skin beneath.
Their clothing shows the same changes: trading out reds and yellows for greens and browns.
They've kept traditional shaved skull to the sides, though they keep the top short to prevent it from catching on the pair of oversized axes they keep on their back.

_Background:_ The Tenakth expelled Yen from their village and all Tenakth lands.
They don't talk about why, but then they don't talk much at all.
They've mentioned their parents — their father is a blacksmith and mother a leatherworker, but the subject seems painful.

_Attitude:_ Most people look at Yen and see a thick-headed brute — a mis-impression Yen is not quick to correct.
Anyone striking up a conversation would soon find them to be more intelligent than most, and quick to laugh with those they consider friends.
They're also quick to anger and all too aware of their ability to do harm, so they tend to keep people at arms' length for their own protection.

_Hopes:_ Yen is still trying to figure out where they fit.
While they agree with the ideals of strength and direct action of their Tenakth forebears, they cannot stomach the tribe's oppression and indifference.
Most days, Yen's bar is low: they hope to meet people who are not inherently afraid of them, or who want to just use them for their size.

_Fears:_ They would not soon admit it aloud, but they worry they will wander alone for the rest of their days, never connecting with anyone.
