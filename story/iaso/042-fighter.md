### Yenevra Feldspar

_Tenakth, fighter, she/her_

_Primary skills:_ melee combat, intimidation, strength, endurance

_Appearance:_ Towering over most, broad-shouldered, and thick-framed, Yenna is a wall of solid muscle.
Where many [Tenakth](https://horizon.fandom.com/wiki/Tenakth) would prefer a base of blue body paint and red mouth and neck, she has replaced the red with white, covering almost all the bronze skin beneath.
Her clothing shows the same changes: trading out reds and yellows for greens and browns.
She's kept traditional shaved skull to the sides, though she keeps the top short so it won't catch on the pair of oversized axes she keeps on her back.

_Background:_ Yenna was expelled from her village and from Tenakth lands.
She doesn't talk about why, but then she doesn't talk much at all.
She's mentioned her parents — her father is a blacksmith and her mother a leatherworker — but the subject seems to pain her.

_Attitude:_ Most people look at Yenna and see a thick-headed brute, and she's fine with that.
If they struck up a conversation they'd soon find her to be more intelligent than most, and quick to laugh with those she considers friends.
She's also quick to anger and all too aware of her ability to do harm, so she tends to keep people at arms' length for their own protection.

_Hopes:_ Yenna is still trying to figure out where she fits.
While she agrees with the ideals of strength and direct action of her Tenakth forebears, she cannot stomach their oppression and indifference.
Most days, her bar is low: she hopes to meet people who are not inherently afraid of her, or who want to just use her for her size.

_Fears:_ She would not soon admit it aloud, but she worries that she will wander alone for the rest of her days, never connecting with anyone.
