## Yenever Feldspar

_Tenakth, fighter_

{:.hanging-indent}
**Primary skills:** melee combat, intimidation, strength, endurance

{:.hanging-indent}
**Background:** The Tenakth expelled Yen from their village and all Tenakth lands.
Yenever doesn't talk about why, but then they don't talk much at all.
They've mentioned their parents — their father is a blacksmith and mother a leatherworker, but the subject seems painful.

{:.hanging-indent}
**Attitude:** Most people look at Yen and see a thick-headed brute — a mis-impression Yen is not quick to correct.
Anyone striking up a conversation would soon find them to be more intelligent than most, and quick to laugh with those they consider friends.
They're also quick to anger and all too aware of their ability to do harm, so they tend to keep people at arms' length for their own protection.

{:.hanging-indent}
**Hopes:** Yen is still trying to figure out where they fit.
While they agree with the ideals of strength and direct action of their Tenakth forebears, they cannot stomach the tribe's oppression and indifference.
Most days, Yen's bar is low: they hope to meet people who are not inherently afraid of them, or who want to just use them for their size.

Yenever's full character sheet is available in the [Adapter](600-adapters.md) for your system.
