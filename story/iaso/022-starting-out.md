## Starting Out

If this is **not** your first tabletop adventure in the world of _Skyline_ you should skip this section and go directly to [Hooks](025-hooks.md).

Otherwise, welcome!

If you have not already picked or created characters, do the following:

1. As a group, look through the [Starter Characters](040-starter-characters.md).
2. Each player should pick a character they find appealing.
   If more than one player wants to try the same character, that's okay!
   Pick a new name, and maybe change a few background details.
3. Each person should print or copy the character sheet for their chosen character, available in the Adapter for your system.

The starter characters each have a set of starting gear, so you won't need to worry about finding weapons, armor, or tools before you start your adventure.

{:.aside}
The starting gear for most tabletop RPG characters will be fine â€” you shouldn't need anything special for this module. 

Start your adventure by skipping ahead to the Adventure section's first entry: [100](100-mothers-crown.md).
