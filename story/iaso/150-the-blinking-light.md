Read aloud:

> A pair of metal doors sag, misaligned in their tracks.
> The split between them emits a teal glow in a slow flashing pattern.
> It's not the bright blue of a working machine, but it's just as artificial.

Prying the door open is straightforward, requiring the equivalent of strength check against Moderate difficulty for one person.
If multiple people work on it together, no roll is required.
One of the people opening the door slices a hand in the effort (even if it's on a lever or pry bar), taking Light damage.

Read aloud:

> The room is clearly some kind of workshop: storage cabinets line the walls, including several which have fallen to the ground and spilled their contents across the floor.
> Counter tops around the room are covered in what might be instruments or tools, but nothing familiar.
> Unlike the other rooms, there are no corpses in here.
>
> The source of the flashing light is a half-dome on one of the counters, maybe a hand's breadth wide at its base.
> A teal ring around that base throbs a slow heartbeat.
> The light from it is very dim, and would be barely noticeable in full daylight.

When someone touches the half-dome, the light stays on for several seconds before going back to its pattern.
It can be moved — it's not attached to anything — but its behavior does not change.

Collectors may search for [Artifacts](590-artifacts.md) if they like, though each may only collect a single artifact for the entire ruins — not just this room.

The search finds something else: a box of triangular metal chips which look familiar to any person who'd ever met Aloy.
The dozen Focuses all seem to be in working order, and it will occur to at least one character to attach theirs to an ear as they'd seen Aloy do it.
That person shows the others how to do it, and one by one the party is connected to the Focus network.
