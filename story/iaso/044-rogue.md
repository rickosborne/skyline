Their build is ropy muscle, but is often concealed or de-emphasized by attire.
The only thing unchanging is their green eyes.
They produce a knife as long as their forearm in combat, though it's not obvious where they keep it.

Most of their possessions seem to be of Carja origin.

_Attitude:_ When trying to get what they want, Thorn is whoever they need to be: forthright, coy, standoffish, flirting, calculating, ignorant.
On the road, sharing a quiet meal, they are much more sedate and reserved.
They'll offer up anecdotes when asked, to a point, but won't offer personal details unless it would serve some larger purpose.

_Hopes:_ If This is to be believed, they've spent the better part of their life going from one "opportunity" to another, but has tired of it and just wants to do something honest for a while.

They won't engage with a situation until they've thoroughly read the room â€” unwilling to risk not having every available fact.
