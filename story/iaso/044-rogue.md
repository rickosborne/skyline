### Thia

_unknown, rogue, she/her_

_Primary skills:_ subterfuge, traps, coercion, stealth

_Appearance:_ Thia is a chameleon: today she is a blonde Carja noble, tomorrow a raven-haired Utaru farmer, next week a chestnut-haired Banuk shaman.
Even her height seems to change, sometimes shrunken and meek, other times tall and imposing.
Her build is ropy muscle, but is often concealed or de-emphasized by her attire.
The only thing unchanging is her green eyes against rosy skin.
She produces a knife as long as her forearm in combat, though it's not obvious where she keeps it.

_Background:_ She's told a dozen stories, but they can't all be true.
Most of her possessions seem to be of Carja origin.

_Attitude:_ When trying to get what she wants, Thia is whoever she needs to be: forthright, coy, standoffish, flirting, calculating, ignorant.
On the road, sharing a quiet meal, she's much more sedate and reserved.
She'll talk about herself when asked, to a point, but won't offer personal details unless it would serve some larger purpose.

_Hopes:_ If she's to be believed, she's spent the better part of her life going from one "opportunity" to another, but has tired of it and just wants to do something honest for a while.

_Fears:_ Thia's eyes always dart around when visiting new places, looking at each and every face.
She won't engage with a situation until she's thoroughly read the room â€” unwilling to risk not having every available fact.
