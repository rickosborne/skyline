**Background:** Thorn has told a dozen stories, but they can't all be true.
They are a chameleon: today a blonde Carja noble, tomorrow a raven-haired Utaru farmer, next week a chestnut-haired Banuk shaman.
Even their height seems to change, sometimes shrunken and meek, other times tall and imposing.
Most of their possessions seem to be of Carja origin.

**Attitude:** When trying to get what they want, Thorn is whoever they need to be: forthright, coy, standoffish, flirting, calculating, ignorant.
On the road, sharing a quiet meal, they are much more sedate and reserved.
They'll offer up anecdotes when asked, to a point, but won't offer personal details unless it would serve some larger purpose.

**Hopes:** If This is to be believed, they've spent the better part of their life going from one "opportunity" to another, but has tired of it and just wants to do something honest for a while.
