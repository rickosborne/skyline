## 114

Read to everyone:

> The trio at the end of the table is a Nora mother, father, and daughter.
> Mother and daughter share the same broad shoulders, dark complexion, and thick braids, while the father has fair skin and bright blonde hair.
> They each greet you as you sit.
> The mother, taking note of your tools and weapons, introduces herself as Iala, explaining that she coordinates construction and repair efforts here in Mother's Watch.
> Her husband is Uln, a fisherman whose profession puts in context the net webbing and many pouches sewn into his clothes.
> Their daughter is Jineko, who looks to be in her late teens or early twenties.

If either Haldred or Van is in your group, or another Oseram or Banuk, Jineko will beckon them over to sit next to her.
She will pepper them with questions about the machine parts she sees on their person, their uses, which machines they come from, how they were obtained, and so on.
It becomes apparent she has an extensive knowledge of the machines of Nora lands and beyond.
Her outfit, like her father's, is covered in pouches and pockets, many of which contain small machine tinkers she has made, which she excitedly takes out and shows off one at a time.

Otherwise, unless any other party members have conspicuous machine parts on them, Jineko will keep to herself.

If asked how long they've been in the area, Iala will respond:

> "We've lived here in Mother's Watch since just before Jineko was born.
> Uln and his father have fished these waters for twice that.
> I led a group of Braves patrolling the border for many years, before handing my spear over to the younger generation.
> I, and others, lobbied the High Matriarchs to open our borders and accept all who came and asked for aid, and as part of that it is my job to ensure we have the roofs and beds to make that happen."

If asked about work opportunities, Iala will respond:

> Iala bobs her head at the group of tradespeople at the other end of the table.
> "We only have one group gathering timber, so we'll probably have you help with that for the next few days."
> Nodding at another, larger group of tradespeople at a far table, she continues.
> "We have other groups ripping lumber and building frames, but they've only got enough wood for the next day or two, and I'd like to give us more lead time."

If asked about fishing in the area, or about feeding this many people, Uln will respond:

> "It's a challenge, for sure.
> We're trying to ensure we don't overfish the rivers and lakes, and I worry about the downed machines bleeding chillwater and blaze and what that will do to our stocks.
> Our hunters are voicing similar concerns about stocking for winter without leaving the animals with no chance of surviving until spring.
> But ... I also appreciate the new smells and flavors our Carja and Oseram friends have brought us."

Eventually, the trio will excuse themselves, leaving you to continue your dinner.
As they get up to leave, you notice that Jineko does not stand up on her own.
Iala crouches down and offers a shoulder to Jineko, who leans heavily on her mother who pulls them up together.
Uln hands Jineko a pair of braces, though both parents keep a watchful eye as Jineko gains her balance.
She gives them a slight nod as they make their way down the hill.
