### Drake

_Nora, Brave (hunter)_

_Primary skills:_ ranged combat, tracking, machine disassembly, negotiation

_Appearance:_ Tall, athletic, and muscular with rich, dark skin and close-shaved hair, Drake speaks with a quiet rumble, which makes them seem older than their 24 years.
Instead of the usual Nora blue face paint, Drake uses a bright yellow to match the alerted gaze of a Watcher, in a complex pattern of straight lines and angles.
The design extends down their neck and left arm, transitioning at the shoulder to interlocked hexagons which run to their wrist.
They are usually found in traditional Brave furs and spun cloths, with a bow across their back, a quiver on one hip, and an infrequently-used machete hanging from the other.

_Background:_ Drake has been a Brave since the Proving five years ago.
They've spent much of that time as part of hunting partings, scouring the Embrace for wandering machines.
In that time they've met every Nora at least once, and seen every inch of Nora land.

_Attitude:_ Drake laughs easy, makes friends easy, and is the first to extend a hand in introduction.
They try to give everyone the benefit of the doubt, and can always find the common ground.
Naivete occasionally gets them in over their head, but they're canny enough to see when someone is trying to manipulate them because of their age or lack of experience.

_Hopes:_ Drake wants to keep the Embrace safe.
They have occasionally wondered how long they can do that, but while still young and capable, they can do their part.

_Fears:_ Drake's parents were killed in the Red Raids just before Drake's Proving, which drives their desire to patrol Nora lands and keep them safe for peaceful people.
They worry they'll miss something, whether deadly machine or deadly human, and someone will die because of it.
