### Drake

_Nora, Brave (hunter), he/him_

_Primary skills:_ ranged combat, tracking, machine disassembly, negotiation

_Appearance:_ Tall, athletic, and muscular with rich, dark skin and close-shaved hair, Drake speaks with a quiet basso rumble, which makes him seem older than his 24 years.
Instead of the usual Nora blue face paint, Drake uses a bright yellow to match the alerted gaze of a Watcher, in a complex pattern of straight lines and angles.
The design extends down his neck and left arm, transitioning at the shoulder to interlocked hexagons which run to his wrist.
He's usually found in traditional Brave furs and spun cloths, with a bow across his back and a quiver on his hip.
A machete hangs from the other hip, but rarely leaves its scabbard.

_Background:_ Drake has been a Brave since his Proving five years ago.
He's spent much of that time as part of hunting partings, scouring the Embrace for wandering machines.
In that time he's met every Nora at least once, and seen every inch of Nora land.

_Attitude:_ Drake laughs easy, makes friends easy, and is the first to extend a hand to introduce himself.
He tries to give everyone the benefit of the doubt, and can always find the common ground.
He occasionally gets in over his head because of his naivete, but he's canny enough to see when someone is trying to manipulate him because of his age or lack of experience.

_Hopes:_ Drake wants to keep the Embrace safe.
He's occasionally wondered how long he can do that, but while he's young and capable, he can do his part.

_Fears:_ Drake's parents were killed in the Red Raids just before his Proving, which drives his desire to patrol the Embrace and keep it safe for peaceful people.
He worries he'll miss something, whether deadly machine or deadly human, and someone will die because of it.
