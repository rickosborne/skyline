## Drake

_Nora, Brave (hunter)_

{:.hanging-indent}
**Primary skills:** ranged combat, tracking, machine disassembly, negotiation

{:.hanging-indent}
**Background:** Drake's parents were killed in the Red Raids just before Drake's Proving, five years ago.
Since then, they've been a Brave, spending much of that time as part of hunting partings, scouring the Embrace for wandering machines.
In that time they've met every Nora at least once, and seen every inch of Nora land.

**Attitude:** Drake laughs easy, makes friends easy, and is the first to extend a hand in introduction.
They try to give everyone the benefit of the doubt, and can always find the common ground.
Naivete occasionally gets them in over their head, but they're canny enough to see when someone is trying to manipulate them because of their age or lack of experience.

{:.hanging-indent}
**Hopes:** Drake wants to keep the Embrace safe.
They have occasionally wondered how long they can do that, but while still young and capable, they can do their part.

Drake's full character sheet is available in the [Adapter](600-adapters.md) for your system.
