## 122

Read to everyone:

> You take your time processing the machines for parts, making sure to get all the intact wire and lenses you can.
> It takes maybe an additional half hour before you start to head back to the west.
> 
> A machine sound and furtive movements in the tall grass grab your attention before you've made it back to the road.
> High-pitched whines and mechanical clicks drift up from a large hole in the ground.
> The hole would be easy to miss, especially if you hadn't come across it in the mid-day sun.
>
> Getting closer, you see a Watcher has fallen in and landed awkwardly, impaled on a stalagmite some twenty or thirty feet below.
> The Watcher is still at least partially functional, as it twists and shudders trying to free itself, but unable to find any leverage.
>
> After a moment's observation, you realize its cries have a strange echo to them â€” the cave below must be much larger than you can see from here.

Especially perceptive members of the group, such as Van, would notice an extra detail: <span class="spoiler">the shiny parts of the Watcher reflect occasional pink and blue glows from light sources you can't see</span>.

One side of the cave has several moss-covered ledges which could be used to get down to the Watcher without falling.
