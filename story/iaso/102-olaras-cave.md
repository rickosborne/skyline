## 102

Read aloud:

> The entrance to Olara's cave sneaks up on you.
> There are no visible markings on the trail, nor are there any braziers at the entrance.
> You round a large boulder and the trail just ends at a crack in the rock face, barely large enough to admit you one at a time.
> 
> Shadows prevent you from seeing inside, but you know you've found the right place: there's a light smell of cooked meats, vegetables, and spices.
> You call into the cave, and Olara shows up a few moments later.

Olara's attitude toward you is neutral.
You can tell she's nonplussed at the idea that Teb thought she might not be safe, and doesn't appreciate having to sneak out in the middle of the night.
She doesn't seem to blame you for that, but nor does she think you did her any favors trying to convince her to stay.

She does not invite you in, and will block any attempts at entry.
If anyone looks, the Focus overlay does not show anything of interest behind her.

As you are about to leave, a voice approaches from the darkness:

> "Olara?  Are you talking to someone?  Please tell me you're talking to someone."

Olara steps out of the way, allowing a man to step forward from behind her.
He's maybe a little older than Olara, with a well-kept beard peppered with what seems to be an early gray. 
He fidgets with a necklace of blue-cable and beads as he talks.

Olara introduces him as Brom, her brother.
He looks uneasy until she reaches out to hold his hand, which calms him almost immediately.
She explains the situation to him, using a gentle voice that contrasts with her tone from moments ago.
Watching them interact, it becomes clear Olara is attempting to help Brom work through some kind of episode.

If someone asks what is wrong with Brom, Olara will rebuff the question and politely ask you to move on.
Should you encounter her again, her attitude toward you will be cold and distant.

If you brought IASO, and a member of your party could step back around the boulder while the others talk, continue on to entry [141](141-iaso-brom.md).

Otherwise, wish the two well and head back down the mountain with entry [142](142-back-down.md).
