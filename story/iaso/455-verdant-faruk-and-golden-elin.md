## Verdant Faruk, Golden Elin, and family

{:.avoid-break-after}
_Carja, refugee farmers in Mother's Watch, both he/him_

{:.hanging-indent}
**Appearance:** Both men are in their late thirties and look like people who have spent their lives doing hard work in the sun.
Faruk has a dark complexion and deep brown skin, while Elin's complexion is closer to his title, a midtone golden-bronze.
Their daughters, Hanin and Lenyara take after each of them, respectively.
Hanin is a few years older, maybe fourteen or fifteen to Lenyara's ten or eleven.

**Attitude:** Both men maintain a positive attitude in front of their daughters.
Any adult, especially a parent, can easily see the concern behind their eyes, but the entire family speaks in terms of having grown everything from the ground up before, and a willingness to do it again.

{:.hanging-indent}
**Hopes:** They are all still shaken by what they saw in the Maizelands, but the community at Mother's Watch has given them hope that they could make a new life here.

**Fears:** The family made it all the way to Mother's Watch before learning of the Eclipse and machine attacks on the village.
They'd hoped that getting away from Meridian and the Sundom would leave them in a safer place, and they are more than a little disconcerted to find their long journey has not guaranteed anything better.
