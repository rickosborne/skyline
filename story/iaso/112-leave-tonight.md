Read to everyone:

> Following Olara, you make your way around the base of All-Mother Mountain.
> There is some moonlight, but much of the journey is below the tree line, making for slow progress.
>
> Only twenty minutes outside of Mother's Watch, you come across a trio of Scrappers.
> They have not been alerted to your presence, and are attending to downed Lancehorns.

The Scrappers are in your path, but you could make a wide arc around them.
You would avoid detection, but it would add an extra half hour to your travel.

You can stealth past them with a skill check at Tricky difficulty — they are distracted, but it's dark, and Olara doesn't have a Focus.

If you engage them, they are far enough apart to take them down one at a time with stealth.
When any of them is alerted it will notify the others.
No wandering machines will join the fray.
Use your System Adapter to resolve a night-time encounter with the Scrappers.
Olara will help if asked — she wields a bladed staff with noticeable skill — but will otherwise stay out of the way and watch you.
