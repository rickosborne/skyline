## 123

Read to everyone:

> The sound of Brom's raised voice draws your attention before they are more than a dozen steps away.
> Though he seemed happy and carefree moments ago, his mood has darkened.

IASO asks you to move close enough for him to be within the Focus' range.
As you can't call them back or follow without raising their suspicion, you can only wait until they round a corner and get what you can from a distance.

Attaching a Focus or Sensor Pad might reveal more.
