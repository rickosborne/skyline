> Finding Teb at Mother's Watch, he tells you there's a group of a half-dozen people who went out to get lumber for the next lodge.
> You help would save a good deal of time.
> He points to the stone wall to the east and tells you to follow it around for maybe ten minutes.

If you have any Nora in your party, they will gather Medicinal Salvebrush berries along the trip, giving them to any injured party members, including the one who hurt their hand on the door the previous night.

If the injured person eats the berries, which any Nora will strongly encourage, they find the wound on their hand closes up over the next hour.
Their Focus makes special note of this.
If they are wearing a Sensor Pad, the Focus overlay reveals a message stating `Regenerative enzymes detected.  Agent catalogued.` before fading away.
Otherwise, the message is `Unknown pharmacological effect detected.  Attach a sensor pad for further analysis.` and lingers before fading.
If the party brought any Sensor Pads with them, they may attach one while they walk, causing the Focus to give the first message.
