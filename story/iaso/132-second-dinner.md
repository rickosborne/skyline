## 132

Read to everyone:

> Dinner is the same mildly raucous outdoor setup as the night before: long tables full of families and workers commingling and commiserating.
> While grabbing your food you catch sight of Jineko, who nods and cocks her head at the empty area next to her family.
> She also makes it clear with a glare that you're not to talk about anything serious in front of her parents.
> Her Focus is barely visible, obscured by a jaunty wreath made of feathers and dangling machine parts.
> The crutches you saw her use last night are visible, leaned against the end of the table by her father.
>
> As you sit, Jineko says: "I heard you had a run-in with some machines today.
> Did you process them for parts?
> Anything you can spare?
> I can offer you good prices for anything in working condition."
>
> You make small talk with Jineko, Grethe, and Uln.
> Jineko guides the conversation to the suggestion that you go back down the hill and sort through your parts while there's still light.
> Grethe and Uln are displeased with the idea, but Jineko's enthusiasm wins them over.
> They move to get up as she does, but she bats at them to sit down, grabbing her crutches.
>
> "Today's a strong day.
> Enjoy a nice dinner together for once.
> I'll be right down the hill."
>
> Accompanying Jineko down to her stall by the main gate, her gait does not betray any change in her condition.
> She explains as she sits, only then relaxing and kicking her feet in slow circles.
>
> "It's taking some getting used to, but I've almost got it.
> I'd like your help tonight â€” getting there, looking around, and getting back in."

If you ask her what she expects to get from the trip:

> "You're not the first to go in there, you know.
> Others have, too, but none have come back with sensor pads.
> You all found something new.
> I want to see what else is there."

If you ask her why she wants to go, herself, or if she's up for it:

> "I've spent years sifting through machine parts.
> You seem competent, but I have to see for myself.
> There might be more artifacts there, which could help the people recovering in All-Mother Mountain."

If you ask her who's in All-Mother Mountain:

> "You haven't seen?
> You didn't think it was odd we've survived multiple attacks from ancient machines, and everyone seems to be whole and healthy?
> My mother's skill with herbs is beyond most, but that can only do so much.
> All-Mother Mountain has been repurposed to house the sick, injured, and dying.
> The glowing smoke from the Deathbringers does unspeakable things to flesh."

If you tell her she can't go, she will only look at you with a challenging eyebrow.

Eventually, she will explain her plan:

> "Three hours from now, everyone will be asleep.
> Only a few Braves will remain on watch.
> Meet me at the foot of the hill.
> I have a plan to get us out and back."

After this, she will get up, still using her crutches, and walk over to the Braves at the main gate.
You can't hear what she says, but she points in your direction a few times, up the hill a few times, and back to you.
The Brave takes some time to convince, before nodding and shrugging.

Jineko starts to head back toward you, but turns and heads for the hill.
You look to see Uln and Grethe approaching.
Jineko waves to you, and the family heads off to a lodge across the forum.

There's not much else you can do beyond finding a place to bed down for a few hours.
