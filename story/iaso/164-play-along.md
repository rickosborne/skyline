Players of Tenakth characters should engage Unira and her parents, Ethsan and Ometra, in a conversation to show that Tenakth are just people, and not inherently good or bad.
If the group does not have a Narrator, other players should take on the roles of the three NPCs.
You may choose to involve contested skill challenges, but they are not required â€” it is just as viable to roleplay it without dice rolls.

Through conversation, you may learn what has already been assumed:

* The trio comes from lands just outside of Sunstone Rock.
* During the Red Raids, the fruit groves of Ethsan and Ometra were pillaged a number of times to feed Tenakth counter forces.
* They only felt safe and comfortable enough to have Unira after everything settled down.
* Because they sell all their fruit to merchants from Meridian, they've never seen any Tenakth who were not taking from them.

There is no specific end goal to this conversation, beyond attempting to engender trust, or at least to defuse tension, with the parents.
Tenakth characters may wish to recount child-friendly stories of their time in the past few years, or what led them to leave the Tenakth clans.
Or, if the player is feeling particularly creative, they might recount a Tenakth folktale about how people are not always what they seem.

Keep track of how the dispositions of Ethsan, Ometra, and Grethe change with the outcome of this conversation.
