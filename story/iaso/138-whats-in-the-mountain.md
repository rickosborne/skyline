The traffic in and out of the mountain catches your eye.
You see many bowls of steaming soup and plates in various configurations going into the mountain, and only empty dishes coming back out.
There are clearly almost as many people inside the mountain as there are out here.

Someone skilled in disguise or deception might be able to get past the two Nora Braves posted guard.
A distraction might also work, but would require excellent stealth, as well as an ability to improvise a plan for getting back out undetected.

One person might be able to get in, at most.

If someone would like to try, use your System Adapter to resolve a social encounter appropriate for getting into a guarded area unnoticed.
Disguise and deception ploys should be made against Tricky difficulty, while stealth should be made against Hard difficulty.
Other non-violent approaches may also work â€” come up with an appropriate skill challenge if you like.
