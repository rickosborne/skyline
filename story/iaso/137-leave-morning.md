Teb's map is clear, but he's right â€” the path around the base of the mountain is slow going.
Each time you think you can shortcut by beginning up the slopes, you hit a sheer drop, requiring you to go back down.

Forty minutes into your trek you come across a group of machines.
One Watcher is doing patrol and scouting duty, watching over Lancehorns with their drill horns working the rock.
Counting the Lancehorns, you can see one for every member of your party.

The machines have not been alerted to your presence.
You may try to sneak past them, at Tricky difficulty.
Going wide around them does not appear to be an option, as they are right in front of the well-traveled trail you know you've been looking for.

If you are detected or choose to confront them, use your System Adapter to resolve a daytime encounter.
Remember that when the Watcher is alerted to your presence it will immediately alert all other machines in the area.
Longhorns, with their herd alertness, do the same thing.

[Once you're past the machines, continue up the trail with entry 102.](102-olaras-cave.md){:.story-link.story-link-continue}
