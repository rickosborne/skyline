Read to everyone:

> You press the flat of the half-dome MAU against the matching circle shown in your Focus.
> IASO says, "Thank you.  This will take a few moments."
> The ring at the dome's base changes to a series of dots, chasing each other around in a chaotic pattern.
>
> After several minutes, the ring settles back into its solid teal glow and IASO speaks.
> "Synchronization complete.
> I was able to find a backup of my procedures database.
> It does not appear complete, as there are many records tagged as placeholders, but it is something.
> One moment, please."

Only to the character who cut their hand, IASO speaks directly:

> I can confirm that your laceration is not life-threatening.
> I do not have access to my usual medical tools, but if we could find an autosuture, I could help you with that.
> May I configure your Focus to alert you if it detects one?

If the character consents, a small icon with some text will show up in the corner of their Focus overlay.
It says `Autosuture`, with a boxy graphic in the general shape of a cupped hand.

Characters with persistent medical conditions will notice that their Focus overlays begin to show more information about their conditions:

* Treatable conditions will be labeled with `Treatment: [PHARMA PLACEHOLDER]`.
* Missing limbs will be labeled with `[PROSTHETICS PLACEHOLDER]`.

IASO will speak aloud again:

> I believe a more complete version of my database might be of assistance.
> I can see that there should be more treatments, but this version of my database has only placeholders where that data should be.
> For example, I know that there should be a pharmacological solution to aid in healing, but I do not have specific data on what it is.
>
> There may be other facilities with more data.
> Would you be willing to take me to them?

If players choose to leave IASO in this facility, its MAU may be left here or where it was discovered.
Otherwise, it can be carried in a pack.
