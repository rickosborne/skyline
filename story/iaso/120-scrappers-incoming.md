## 120

Read aloud:

> The Scrappers come over the hill to the northeast, with just enough glare from the sun on the Horizon to cost you all several seconds of confusion.
> Even more unlucky, you realize this isn't just a trio: you've counted a half dozen before you turn and run the other way.
> The treeline isn't far from the road, but you know you were spotted.
> You head for a cluster of rocks and boulders, hoping to at least get a height advantage. 

All party members make another perception check against Hard difficulty.
Anyone who fails falls in an unmarked hole between the rocks, taking Light damage.

Otherwise, even characters who notice the hole decide it's probably safer to get out of the Scrapper's line of sight.
Everyone gets down into the cave, backing away from the ledge and into shadow.
You can hear the high-pitched pulse of the Scrappers' scanning components firing one after another.
Scrappers walk by the hole, but seem unable to detect you.
