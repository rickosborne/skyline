Read aloud:

> Crouched in the trees, you see a cluster of Scrappers coming in from the north.
> But this group isn't just two or three â€” it's easily a dozen strong.
> They don't seem to notice you, and begin to curve around to follow the road heading east.
>
> Silently and collectively, you begin to sink back farther into the trees, trying to put even more distance between you and the road.
> As the machines get closer, the stragglers begin to close ranks, causing them to fan out.
> Several scrappers come within strides of the treeline.

An unmarked cave entrance, just a hole in some rocks, is behind you.
If appropriate for your system, all party members make a perception check against Hard difficulty.
Anyone who fails falls in the hole taking Light damage.

Otherwise, even characters who notice the hole decide it's probably safer than being detected by that many Scrappers.
