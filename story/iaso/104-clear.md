## 104

{:.avoid-break-after}
Read to everyone:

> The silver discs adhere to Pren's skin without making a sound, against his unmoving chest.
> Within seconds of them being attached, Pren's Focus label switches to `CARDIAC ARREST`.
> The label changes again, this time to `VT`. 
>
> A countdown timer from 5 begins to tick in the Focus overlay, with a flashing message which is also spoken directly to the party in IASO's voice: `STEP BACK NOW!`
> The Sensor Pads will not activate until no one else is touching Pren, but the admonition continues and becomes increasingly intrusive.
>
> There's no flashy, holographic or AR effect.
> One moment Pren is still, the next he is coughing and gasping for breath.
> He's not entirely conscious, though his eyes flutter and he makes small sounds.
>
> The Focus overlay of Pren stops glowing red, and his label fades away.

If you need to, now might be a good time to detach the Sensor Pads from Pren's chest, before he's fully aware.
You may also choose to leave them in place, but you'd then have to explain them.

If you have IASO with you, it will communicate directly to the party:

{:.spoiler.block}
> It looks like he is stable for now.
> A functioning MedBed would show more, but his condition may improve with better diet and reduced alcohol consumption.
> Please encourage him to avoid strenuous exercise for the next two weeks.

When Pren wakes up, if someone thinks to give him Medicinal Salvebrush berries and the Sensor Pads are still attached, they will find that none of the Focuses register any changes in Pren.
(Unless someone gives him his own Focus, which will then show only him the same message as before.)

Pren does wake, and though he does not know what happened, he is coherent.
He complains of being sore all over, and thinks he just missed an axe swing and fell.
Using whatever means you think appropriate, you'll need to persuade him to sit or lie on the cart so you can take him back to Mother's Watch.
