Congratulations, you've completed this module!

What comes next?
Here are a few ideas for you:

* What does the Override Controller do?  Why does it show a Watcher and a Strider?

* What should you do with IASO?  Could it be of help to the people in All-Mother Mountain?

* IASO mentioned other facilities.  Could those be delves near here?

* Is there anything you can do for Olara?

* Would there be more interesting parts like the Override Controller to be found in the wreckage of the many machines that raided the Embrace?

You might also consider following the loose threads from _Horizon: Zero Dawn_:

* Aloy managed to stop the Buried Shadow, so why are machines still hostile when you get too close?

* What's behind the door in All-Mother Mountain?

* Were the Eclipse wiped out, or are they just in hiding?

* What of the Shadow Carja?
