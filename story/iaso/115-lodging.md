## 115

Read to everyone:

> It's now more than an hour after sundown.
> The merchants have all closed up for the night, the remains of dinner have been stored, and raucous activity has been replaced with hushed whispers on the chill night air.
>
> The crowd of people looking for lodging has thinned out by the time you approach the pair of Nora managing the logistics.
> They introduce themselves as Ziara and Wen.
> Seeing your weapons and tools, they gather quickly that you are not refugees.
> They explain how both lodges for tradespeople are already full to overflowing, so you'll have to sleep two-to-a-bed in one of the family lodges.
> They also ask that you be sensitive to this when you rise tomorrow, as many refugee families are not yet accustomed to before-dawn activities.
