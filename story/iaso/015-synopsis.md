## Synopsis

Our adventurers find themselves in Mother's Watch, the ruins in which Aloy found her first Focus device.
Prying open a door reveals some kind of laboratory full of strange medical instruments, beds, and a stockpile of Focuses, ready to use.
Following the prompts they see through their Focuses, they reactivate the power to an AI which identifies itself as IASO.
IASO notices that one of the party sliced their hand when opening the door, and walks the adventurer through the steps to use one of the instruments to disinfect and stitch the gash closed.
The AI claims it can do more to help other injured and sick people, but it needs the adventurers to help it reconnect with the other AIs.
