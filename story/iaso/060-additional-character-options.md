## Additional Character Options

TODO overview text

### Blindness

This module includes story content directed toward blind and vision-impaired characters.
While not true of all machine types, most of them make enough noise and have heavy enough impact that it should be considered perfectly reasonable for blind characters to thrive in the setting.
This is true even for blind characters who choose a life of adventure and machine hunting!

While none of the starter characters are blind or otherwise vision-impaired by default, you should feel free to make that alteration if you like.

There are no changes to character stats for being blind in this setting.
Of course, if your particular RPG system includes rules for blind characters, it's up to you whether to apply them.
You'll likely find the stock blindness rules of older systems to be superfluous, as you'll see when you get to the relevant parts of the story.
More modern systems may include blind character treatment more aligned with the _Skyline_ setting.

### Additional Persistent Medical Conditions

Like blindness above, this story includes narrative elements which address assistive technologies and persistent medical conditions.
Congenital heart issues, missing limbs, reduced immune response, etc, should not be considered barriers for your characters to adventure in the world of _Skyline_.

While a single module cannot address every possible body type or medical condition, players who wish their characters to represent the diversity of the human experience should find this module a comfortable space to express themselves.

The next section, [Time & Tide](070-time-and-tide.md) includes additional details on how disability is represented in the _Skyline_ setting and this _IASO_ module.
It does contain spoilers for the story, and should be considered optional reading for Adventurers, and suggested reading for Narrators.
