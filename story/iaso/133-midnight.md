## 133

Read to everyone:

> Wispy clouds obscure the moon, leaving barely enough light to see as you reach the bottom of the hill.
> A dark form shifts, impatient, with their back to you.
> They turn, and you're faced with a Carja Hunter: bow in one hand, quiver dangling from one hip, heavy leather bag across their back, and large feather-covered Sawtooth jaw headdress atop a face lined with makeup in angular, starburst patterns.
> It takes a moment to recognize Jineko, and you only do so because you know it must be her.
>
> When she speaks, her voice has the husky undertones of her mother, plus the imperious tone of a Carja addressing Nora savages.
>
> "The Braves believe Grethe is sending you out to gather more herbs.
> After a day of felling timber, you were given a few hours of sleep before heading back again.
> We do not know each other, only the task we were given."
>
> Without waiting for your assent, she turns and walks toward the main gate.
> She has a slight limp, but otherwise does not seem to need any assistance.
>
> Two Braves stand watch at the gate â€” one above, and one on the ground.
> The man nods as you approach, opening a thin sally port door to allow exit.
> He doesn't address you, but whispers a count to himself as you pass, calling the total to the woman above as he closes the door behind you.
> The motion sends a small puff of fresh-cut wood smell which catches up to you.
>
> Jineko, again, takes the lead.

If you comment on her ability to walk, she won't say much about it:

> "It's ... taking some adjustment."

Narrators may choose to make Jineko talkative, taciturn, or whatever fits her backstory.
For guidance, see the <a href="172-jineko-focus-bts.html">notes on Jineko's motivation in entry 172</a>.

If asked why she is disguised and acting in secret:

> "How am I to explain this to my parents, or the Matriarchs?
> The All-Mother came to me in a dream and healed my body?
> Why me and not one of the suffering in All-Mother Mountain?
> And what happens when they see my Focus, or the sensor pads on my back and legs?
> No.  I need time to think.
> I might be able to convince them if I can find something to help.
> But ... I don't know."

The remainder of the walk to the ruins is quiet, under a dark and cloudy sky.
You do not encounter any machines along the way, though you disturb a number of owls and foxes competing for rats.
