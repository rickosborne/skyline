## Pren

{:.avoid-break-after}
_Nora, tradesperson in Mother's Watch, he/him_

{:.hanging-indent}
**Appearance:** Pren is short, stocky, and in his late 30s, though years of labor and hard living have etched in wrinkles which make him look a decade older.
His straight dark hair is pulled back into a small tail, with silver temples that continue down into unruly white chops.
It's hard to tell if he gets his acorn-brown skin from his parents or the sun.
His hands are calloused and dry, though you might not get much occasion to see that as he always seems to have tools in them.
He doesn't have any Nora tattoos or markings.

**Attitude:** Pren is socially neutral — he's not going to cross a room to meet someone new, but he's affable and outgoing with his friends.
That distance doesn't mean a lack of empathy, though — he's acutely aware of the heightened anxieties of the incoming refugees.

**Hopes:** Pren loves being a jack-of-all-trades.
He's not interested in money or power, just in helping to improve the lives of those around him.

**Fears:** Pren is self-conscious about not being much of a hunter.
He worries, especially with the recent Eclipse attacks, that other people might think less of him because he doesn't want to pick up a spear or bow.
Lately, trying to be seen as a "true Nora" has led to more social drinking than he's used to.
