## 151

The Nora Brave guards are not amused by your attempts to get into All-Mother Mountain.
However, they seem unsurprised instead of angry, as if they've seen many similar and more inventive attempts.

They assure you that you're being kept out of the mountain for the best of those inside, many of whom are ill and don't need to be exposed to whatever contagions you might accidentally bring in with you.
Exceptions might be made if someone inside requested your presence, but until then they politely ask that you stay out.
