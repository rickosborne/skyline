_Oseram, merchant in Mother's Watch, he/him_

**Appearance:** Arund is a top-heavy man in his early 40s, with arms and shoulders used to lugging around crates of machine parts, but legs used to standing in one place all day.
He's usually in Oseram work attire: loose, flappy robes with lots of concealed pockets and loops for tools, with decorate steel plates strapped onto it.
He wears a matching leather and cloth cap to cover a balding head of light skin surrounded by a halo of brown hair.

**Attitude:** Arund is trying to unlearn decades of bad habits around distrust and deceit.
The impulse to assume he's being taken advantage of is strong, though he's learned to recognize it and push it down, especially for people who've proven themselves to deal fairly.
This leads to him being a little distant at first, but then to extend a hand to bridge the gap he's created.

**Hopes:** Today, Arund wants to establish himself as a necessary part of the Mother's Watch economy.
Tomorrow, maybe he'll want more, but better to focus on today.

**Fears:** Arund worries that the current Nora good will toward outlanders in the Embrace will evaporate with tomorrow's morning mist.
While he doesn't subscribe to Nora philosophies, he likes the climate and the lower chance of being killed walking down the road.
The Old Ones' machines wouldn't try attacking the Nora again, right?
