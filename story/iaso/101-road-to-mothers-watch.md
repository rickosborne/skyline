## 101: The Road to Mother's Watch

{:.avoid-break-after}
Read to everyone:

> Just before dawn the road is clear, and the air has a slight chill.
> The temperature stays comfortable even as the sun rises over the mountains to the east.
> The occasional Grazer, Strider, or Watcher packs are visible across the river, calm and either unaware or unconcerned with your presence.
> 
> A lone Nora merchant with a paltry selection stands at the first campsite.
> He says you're the first group going south he's seen for the day.
> You share an early lunch with him before continuing on.
> 
> It's a long but uneventful day on the road.
> The sun is just beginning to dip below the mountains to the west as you pass through the Main Embrace Gate.
> The Nora guards there give a cursory inspection of your gear, but nothing catches their interest.
> Just on the other side, another merchant selling hunting goods is packing up for the evening.
> She advises you to take the first bridge, which you do.
>
> The last of the remaining light fades, and you can just make out the glow of Mother's Watch in the distance.

If your party is escorting anyone, such as the father and son from the Hooks section, they will get excited and sprint for Mother's Watch.
You're too tired from a long day of walking, so you yell that you'll catch up, keeping your pace.
