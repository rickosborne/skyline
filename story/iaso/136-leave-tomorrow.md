## 136

Read aloud:

> It's already been a long day and you're exhausted from your trip.
> You do your best to persuade Olara to wait until morning.
> She eventually agrees, but the set of her jaw makes it clear she's not happy about it.
>
> Teb works with a few other Nora to ask some refugee family members to share beds, just barely finding enough for your party.
> Thanking him, you fall asleep to the sound of a dozen other people in the same room, all trying to impact each other as little as possible.
>
> You're awake before the sun, only to find that Olara is already gone.
> Teb seems unsurprised by this, shaking his head.
> "She probably left moments after we put out the lights."
> Frowning, his eyes again pass over your Focuses.
>
> "If you'd be willing, I'd like you to check on her, to make sure she got home safe.
> She can take care of herself, but I've never seen a pack of that many machines in the Embrace, and she's just one person.
> As much as I'd love to put you to work on a new lodge, we can't lose any more Nora today."

Teb doesn't have anything to offer you for the effort, beyond a shared breakfast.
He draws a map in the dirt of the location of Olara's home.
It's a cave on All-Mother Mountain, though there's no direct route and the path around the base is not an easy one.
He thinks you can be there and back again by mid-morning, if you're willing.
