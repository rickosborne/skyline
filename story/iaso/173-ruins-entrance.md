Read aloud:

> A cloud of bats flies past you as you crouch in the cave.
> Oddly, they come from a dark area below you, and off to your side.
> Below the sharp scent of guano and bat is a damp, metallic smell.
>
> The ground above you thumps with the passing of each Scrapper.
> But the thumps don't all recede into the distance â€” a number slow and stay louder than you expect.
>
> The high-pitched shriek of rending metal, a Scrapper doing its job on some unseen machine, destroys any hope that they will move along.
> As the random footsteps get too close for comfort, you decide to move farther into the cave.
>
> The occasional footprints in the dirt are clear and aren't all covered in guano or moss.
> Someone else has been here no more than a few weeks ago.

There's just enough light to let everyone work their way down and deeper into the cave.
At least one person will need to create light.

When they do, the walls reveal what everyone was already expecting: you've stumbled into ruins of the Old Ones.
Find the map for [Mother's Watch Ruins](510-mothers-watch-ruins.md).
The entry numbers marked with a triangle &#9658; require a Focus to see.
If you're just starting out, you probably don't have a Focus yet!
The others, marked with a circle, can be seen and investigated by anyone.
