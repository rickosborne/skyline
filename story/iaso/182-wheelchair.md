Read to everyone:

> Collapsed against a wall and covered in moss is a jumble of metal rings, bars, and that same metal cloth.
> It takes some effort, but you manage to pull them apart and clean them off, revealing a half dozen objects your Focus labels as simply `Wheelchair`.
> Animated graphics show how to split apart the rings, expanding the device into what appears to be a single-person cart, or a chair with built-in wheels.
> The woven metal seat and back seem completely intact, and exhibit that same resistance to damage.
> The wheels also appear to be made of some kind of woven metal, though much thicker and yet at the same time more giving.
>
> Despite their bulk, the wheelchairs are surprisingly light, with each weighing no more than a few pounds/kilos.
> Several configurations are available, as you dig them out of their tangle.

These wheelchairs are completely mechanical — they contain no electronic components.
They can otherwise be as complex or as simple as you like.
Pushrim, belted, geared, unidirectional ratcheting — whatever the players think might be useful.

<aside class="narrator-note">
<header>Narrator note:</header>
<p markdown="true">Players should decide whether wheelchairs are a novel concept, or if they already exist in some form or another.
The story as written is intentionally ambiguous about this point.
Narrators who decide they already exist may consider whether to have Jineko in a wheelchair, instead of on crutches, when the party first meets her.</p>
<p>These wheelchairs are intentionally low-tech to provide a "non-scary" mobility aid where narratively appropriate.</p>
