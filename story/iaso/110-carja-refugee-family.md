Read to everyone:

> As the Carja family gets up from the table and begins to gather their dishes, the adults notice you looking for a place to sit and beckon you over.
> The two middle-aged men are accompanied by a pair of teenage girls, all of whom look travel-worn and tired, but in good health.
> The men introduce themselves as Verdant Faruk and Golden Elin, and their daughters Hanin and Lenyara.

Narrators who would like more background can read [the bio for Faruk and Elin](455-verdant-faruk-and-golden-elin.md).

If asked how they came to Mother's Watch, Verdant Faruk will answer:

{:.spoiler.block}
> "We used to grow food crops in the Royal Maizelands.
> Not just corn — we could grow anything the Sun King desired.
> But the day of the Eclipse, a Deathbringer awoke from deep beneath our fields.
> We'd had no idea it was there, our we'd never have let our daughters ... anyway."
>
> "We're just farmers.
> We thought we should leave the fighting to people with spears and slings and Oseram cannons, not rakes and hoes.
> But when the Deathbringer awoke ... it destroyed everything.
> It didn't even move!
> It just sat there, shuddering and creaking."
>
> "Black smoke poured out of it, eating everything it touched.
> Elin and I sat and watched as our crops withered, greyed with death, and crumbled and vanished before our eyes.
> The smoke glowed red, getting brighter the more it ate, and returned to the Deathbringer, feeding it.
> Ancient wounds repaired themselves, bending metal plates back into place with horrible shrieks and groans."
>
> "We didn't wait to see what would happen when all the wounds were closed.
> We grabbed what we could carry on our backs and ran, away from Shadow lands, of course.
> At Daytower, we heard the Nora had opened their gates, so here we are."

If asked what they think they will do next, Golden Elin will answer:

{:.spoiler.block}
> "We're farmers — that's really all we know.
> The weather is a little different in Nora lands, and we're told it gets much colder in the winter, but we think we can make something here.
> The Nora don't seem to have much in the way of worked land, and we don't know much about hunting, so I think we can learn from each other.

If asked about "Verdant" and "Golden", the older daughter Hanin will take her sister's hand and answer:

{:.spoiler.block}
> "Back home we grew all kinds of things, but before we were born our dads started with just a single field of corn.
> When we were kids the Sun King visited the Maizelands and saw that our fields were the healthiest around.
> He saw the green stalks and golden silk and said it was all so bright it hurt his eyes.
> His adviser, I forget his name, said it was a most verdant display, and the Sun King agreed.
> They doubled our land, and we've gotten more ever since.
> Until the Deathbringer ate it."

If Thia is in your party, <span class="spoiler">Thia will recognize this story and may take this opportunity to establish a rapport with the family</span>.

If asked about the group of people gathering around the lodge, the adults will take turns explaining:

{:.spoiler.block}
> "Many Carja families have come through, but not all have stayed.
> The builders have been setting up new lodges as fast as the lumber can be collected, but there's never enough space.
> Each night, the Nora coordinate space and beds for all of us."
