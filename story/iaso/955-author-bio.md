## Author Bio

Rick Osborne has been a tabletop gamer since elementary school, when he and his friends would spend hours completely ignoring the teacher as they generated character after character, passing _AD&D_ and _Lone Wolf_ books back and forth beneath their desks.
_Skyline_ is his first serious effort at building out a cohesive tabletop gaming product, though he's not new to such things â€” he's been a professional Web developer since the mid-1990s.
