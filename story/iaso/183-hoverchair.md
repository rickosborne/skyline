Read to everyone:

> Once you know what to look for, the device your Focus labels as `Hoverchair` seems obvious.
> The metal tube frame looks like it was taken from a wheelchair, but with the wheels removed.
> Instead, an interconnected mesh of more tubes on the undercarriage sports a number of discs like the ones you saw on the harness.
>
> Applying power does exactly what you would expect: the device hovers several feet off the ground, crackling with static discharges.
> As the chair gains height, the undercarriage compacts a bit to provide more clearance for ground objects.

Sitting in the chair, a person sees additional AR controls, with several adaptive configurations.
The basic controls involve directional movement and heading, as well as elevation, which seems to be software-locked to no more than 3ft (ca. 1m) off the ground.

Unlike the harness, the chair does offer propulsion without mechanical aid.
Speed is equivalent to a walk by default, but can be cranked up to a fast run as needed.

The chair's interface with the Focus also gives it the ability to traverse difficult terrain.
When adjacent to a rise of up to 7ft (ca. 2.1m), the chair provides controls to override the normal 3ft (1m) elevation limitation to lift to that level.

Once a character's Focus has linked with the chair, some remote controls are also available.
The chair can be called to the character from up to 50ft (ca. 15 m) away, and will navigate reasonable terrain, including elevation changes, to do so.
Similarly, the chair can be piloted up to the same distance away.
Only one Focus may be linked with the chair at a time.

<p markdown="true">Players who'd like additional ideas for hoverchair capabilities might do well to read through old X-Men comics with [Professor Xavier's hoverchair](https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Hoverchair).
Like the harness, narrators and players are encouraged to quest to extend its capabilities over time.</p>
