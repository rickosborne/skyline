## 108

Read to everyone:

> As you approach the exit, you hear the dull rhythmic thumps of at least one machine walking on the ground above you.
> Looking up to track the sound, you notice that the Focus reveals a purple long-necked outline of a Watcher.
> Smaller, as if farther away above ground, a second Watcher's outline is visible.
> As you pause on each Watcher, additional details are shown for that machine, including a bright yellow area which has its own Focus labeling: `Eye`.

Characters who regularly hunt or process machines will instantly recognize the yellow areas as components targeted by hunters.

Continuing aloud:

> The outline of each Watcher occasionally disappears as it moves too far from you, reappearing a short distance away.
> Pausing to observe its movements causes the Focus to present additional information: a sequence of triangular icons forming a loop, animating along the direction they indicate.
> Each Watcher is clearly following a path, though the paths occasionally change, mere moments before the Watcher changes its routine.
> They appear to be searching for something.

IASO does not have any observations or aid regarding the Watchers â€” IASO seems unfamiliar with them.

The party can wait in the cave and will not be detected by the Watchers unless they attempt to do so intentionally.
The Watchers, if alerted, will not enter the cave and will instead wait outside.
If left alone, the Watchers will search the area for the next thirty minutes, without finding whatever they're looking for, before heading off to the north.

If the party wishes to leave the cave before then, use your System Adapter to resolve a daytime encounter with the two Watchers.
No wandering machines will join the encounter, and the Watchers are unaware of the party's presence until alerted.
