Read to everyone:

> As you approach the exit, you can again hear the continued whine of shredding metal.
> Listening for a moment, you also hear the rhythmic thumps of at least one additional machine patrolling the area above you.
>
> Looking up to track the sound, you notice that the Focus reveals a purple outline of what each Scrapper.
> As you pause on each Scrapper, additional details are shown for that machine, including two yellow areas which each have their own Focus labeling (`Power Cell` and `Radar`).

Characters who regularly hunt machines will instantly recognize the yellow areas as components targeted by hunters.

Continuing aloud:

> The Focus overlay shows one Scrapper on patrol.
> It occasionally disappears as it moves too far from you, reappearing a short distance away.
> Pausing to observe its movements causes the Focus to present additional information: a sequence of triangular icons forming a loop, animating along the direction they indicate.
> The Scrapper is clearly following the path.

Counting the Scrapper outlines yields a number equal to your party size, all intent on disassembling downed machines, plus one more on patrol.

IASO does not have any observations or aid regarding the Scrappers.

The party can wait in the cave and will not be detected by the Scrappers unless they attempt to do so intentionally.
The Scrappers, if alerted, will not enter the cave and will instead wait outside.
If left alone, they will work through the night and leave just before dawn, having removed anything of value from the downed machines.

If the party wishes to leave the cave before then, use your System Adapter to resolve a night-time encounter with the Scrappers.
Each Scrapper is working on a downed Watcher, which may have salvageable components if searched in time.
No wandering machines will join the encounter, and the Scrappers are unaware of the party's presence until alerted.

The party can also make a run for Mother's Watch, which will alert the Scrappers.
You may also attempt to sneak past the Scrappers with Moderate difficulty.
If the Scrappers detect the party, they will chase all the way to Mother's Watch, where they will be killed by Nora Braves, but the party will not get a chance to loot the machines.
The people of Mother's Watch are unsurprised by this, and will chide you for being out after dark, but are otherwise just grateful you've arrived.
