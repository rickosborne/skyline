### Van

_Banuk, historian_

{:.hanging-indent}
**Primary skills:** lore, martial combat, machine subversion

{:.hanging-indent}
**Appearance:** Van is of average height and athletic build, with a gender-neutral presentation.
They keep their black hair shaven completely from their ruddy scalp, though most of the time this is covered by a headdress with Stalker influences.
Their dark brown eyes don't seem to blink often enough, though it may just be because they shine so bright against the band of black face paint they stripe from forehead to cheek and ear to ear.
The signature Banuk blue-cable runs from wrist to wrist, through their forearms and biceps, and across their shoulders.
They seem to be in their 30s, but it's hard to be sure.

{:.hanging-indent}
**Background:** Van's werak dispersed nine years ago when its chieftain was lost to the Red Raids.
Van, wanting to understand what would motivate one tribe to turn on those around it, began to journey from one tribe to the next to learn about them.
Openly when possible, such as with the Nora, or in disguise when necessary, such as with the Tenakth, Van's travels have taken them to places considered only fables by some.
This has given them an empathy with all tribes and machines, even the ones considered dangerous and hostile.
Their memory for local history is often surprising, as Van has listened intently to the stories told around every campfire they've visited.

{:.hanging-indent}
**Attitude:** Van is curious, attentive, and patient.
They have a love of story, as well as a driving need to understand how things work â€” whether machines, societies, or people.
They don't have much regard for material possessions, which would only weigh them down on their travels, or shards, which pale in value to the stories and knowledge they'd prefer to barter.
Quick to reach out a helping hand, but slow to jump into a quarrel they don't understand, Van can occasionally appear standoffish and uncaring while they take the time to gather information to understand the situation.

{:.hanging-indent}
**Hopes:** Van's interpretation of the Banuk mantra of "survive and prevail" focuses on what they see as vital to either: "learn".
Outwardly, they want little more than to continue to meet new people and see new places.
Inwardly, they hope they can use their experiences to give perspective to those who need it.

{:.hanging-indent}
**Fears:** Van has seen the broad extents of the human experience, including some truly horrible acts committed against each other.
Van has also had to abandon villages and tribes when no amount of reason or perspective could reach them.
This has planted the seeds of doubt that Van could ever do enough, or that one day they'll be too curious and too slow and will fall to a horrible act, becoming a story themselves.
