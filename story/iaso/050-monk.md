## Van

_Banuk, historian_

{:.hanging-indent}
**Primary skills:** lore, martial combat, machine subversion

{:.hanging-indent}
**Background:** Van's werak dispersed nine years ago when its chieftain was lost to the Red Raids.
Van, wanting to understand what would motivate one tribe to turn on those around it, began to journey from one tribe to the next to learn about them.
Openly when possible, such as with the Nora, or in disguise when necessary, such as with the Tenakth, Van's travels have taken them to places considered only fables by some.
Their memory for local history is often surprising, as Van has listened intently to the stories told around every campfire they've visited.

{:.hanging-indent}
**Attitude:** Van is curious, attentive, and patient, with a love of story, with a curiosity to understand how things work â€” whether machines, societies, or people.
They don't have much regard for material possessions, which would only weigh them down on their travels, or shards, which pale in value to the stories and knowledge they'd prefer to barter.
Quick to reach out a helping hand, but slow to jump into a quarrel they don't understand, Van can occasionally appear standoffish and uncaring while they take the time to gather information to understand the situation.

{:.hanging-indent}
**Hopes:** Van's interpretation of the Banuk mantra of "survive and prevail" focuses on what they see as vital to either: "learn".
Outwardly, they want little more than to continue to meet new people and see new places.
Inwardly, they hope they can use their experiences to give perspective to those who need it.
