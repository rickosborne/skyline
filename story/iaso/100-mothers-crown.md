> The Nora have opened their borders, for the first time in generations.
> Carja refugees from the destruction at Meridian threaten to overwhelm Nora resources, even with the help of Oseram artisans working around the clock to rebuild and expand Nora infrastructure the entire region.
>
> You have worked hard for the last two weeks in Mother's Crown.
> The Crown should be able to handle the next wave of refugees, thanks to the lodges you've helped build.
> But word has been going around that Mother's Watch doesn't have enough workers to keep up with demand.
> You've decided to make the trip and see what you can do to help.
