## Hooks

If the party is a group of players new to the _Horizon_ setting, you should have already gone through [Starting Out](022-starting-out.md) and can skip this section.

Otherwise, the party will need to find themselves making a journey on the road to Mother's Watch.
One of the following hooks may be helpful:

* A contract to deliver Lancehorn drills to Mother's Crown.
* Escort a refugee father and son who were separated from the mother and daughter who have already made their way to Mother's Crown.
  With this hook the refugees will run far ahead of the party as they get within sight of the Crown, leaving the party alone.
* Scouting the area around Mother's Heart, which still turns away non-Nora visitors, because you're curious.

Once the party finds themselves on the road to Mother's Watch, skip to the narrative section of the module and start the adventure with entry [101](101-road-to-mothers-watch.md).
