Players of blind or deaf characters should read the section on [Focus as Assistive Device](../../guide/setting/751-focus.md) from the Setting Guide.
A number of things happen as these characters attach their Focuses, which are described in that section.

Characters with other persistent medical conditions — heart defects or missing limbs, for example — will see an overlay on their vision when the Focus goes online.
The overlay clearly represents an outline of themselves, with some kind of red indicator of the condition.

Characters with heart or blood disorders will hear a voice and see an overlay, rotating through several languages:

> Monitoring is available for your condition.
> Please attach a sensor pad in the indicated yellow location.

An AR overlay will highlight a box in the room of what looks like coin-sized discs.
One side of each disc feels tacky when touched, but does not stick to anything other than skin.
Characters who press this disc against their skin near the indicated location will find that it stays in place for all types of activity, including swimming.
The discs are easy to peel off with effort, though it takes some practice to do this without some pain.

A sensor pad begins streaming data to the wearer's Focus as soon as it is attached.
The wearer sees an unobtrusive overlay with some kind of monitoring appropriate for their condition.
Curious wearers will eventually figure out that it can be modified to show historical data if desired.
For some conditions, the Focus prompts the wearer with the option to notify other Focuses of medical events, such as seizures or blood values.

If a character chooses not to apply a sensor pad, the message will fade after a minute or so.
Curious wearers will eventually figure out how to make this message go away faster if they choose.

In cases where the Focus will likely not be able to offer assistance or monitoring, it will acknowledge the condition for some amount of time before showing an error message:

> Assistance may be available to you.
> Cannot contact IASO.
> Please reset this device, or seek support.

Characters with missing limbs will notice that the overlay of their body includes what are clearly representations of artificial prosthetic limbs.
A search of the room, however, does not reveal anything that looks like what is shown by the Focus.

After another few seconds the outline of the character's body and the error message will fade away, returning the Focus to normal operation.
