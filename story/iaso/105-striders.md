## 105

{:.avoid-break-after}
Read to everyone:

> You've finally convinced Pren to get on the cart when a familiar high-pitched whinny sounds from just a dozen strides away.
> With everyone focused on Pren, no one noticed the Striders approaching. 

Using your System Adapter, resolve a daytime encounter with the Striders.
There are as many of them as there are in your party, not counting Pren or the other tradespeople.
The Striders are all alerted to your presence, though they seem just as surprised as you â€” they do not get a surprise round.

The Striders are already close enough to make hitting a Blaze Canister risky.

Pren will stay on the cart.
If you did not convince the others to leave, two of them will assist you if you ask.
One has a bow with normal arrows, while the other will use an axe.
Otherwise, they will form up around Pren and prevent the Striders from getting too close, but without causing any significant damage.
